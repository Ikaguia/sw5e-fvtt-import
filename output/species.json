Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The bith's internal systems are different from most humanoids, as the bith have only one lung, and exhale through their skin. Bith also lack a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin-flaps of their cheeks.</p>\r\n<p>The other bith senses are also acute. Bith can sense the tonal qualities of sound as well as other species sensed colors. Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun's, can see microscopic details of nearby objects, but are extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors is the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It is described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, bith have high manual dexterity which helps them manipulate fine tools, though their physical prowess with gross motor skills was only average.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Bith are one of the galaxy's most ancient civilizations, with a history going back millions of years. This antiquity garners respect in certain quarters, such as among the Gree, who gave them more respect than other, \"younger\" species.

In this \"Bothan Way\", the pursuit of power and influence is paramount. Thus, individual bothans put their own political and economic success above all other concerns, and as a species, bothans put their own advancement ahead of other intergalactic interests. The volume of backstabbing, subtle character assassination and political maneuvering in bothan society is dizzying, and results in many species stereotyping bothans as untrustworthy. In fact, most bothans are habitually paranoid, believing that anyone who's not working with them, is working against them. In times of crisis, the focus of bothan society shifts to a survivalist state known as \"ar'krai\". When engaged in ar'krai, all fit bothans volunteer to defend their species from impending extinction. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Male bothan names are often trickey while female's are soft.

Genetic analysis indicate that they are an offshoot of humanity, and it is believed that moving underground led to a divergence between them and baseline Humans. Their blue skin, jet black hair and red eyes generally command attention; these features make them physically striking and instantly recognizable.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Chiss society is highly structured and ordered with the rule of law being enforced by a group of four affiliations known as the Ruling Families: the Csapla, Nuruodo, Inrokini and Sabosen. These are not biological family groupings but instead different branches of their government. Every chiss claims affiliation to one of the four families, as determined by both tradition and place of birth. The family names are more of a cultural holdover; the bloodlines had grown so co-meddled that any chiss could claim affiliation to any of the ruling families. In spite of the outward impression of calm and order that the chiss like to project to outsiders, there were evidently tensions within the Families; political assassinations are a real part of chiss political life for the Ruling Families.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>A chiss true-name has 3 parts, each separated by an apostrophe. The first part is their family name, the second part is their root name, and the third part is their occupation. Chiss rarely share their true-name with non-chiss, and usually go by their root name. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Names.</strong> Crorcu'ecuk'unist, Dash'esoru'ishur, Jerd'ecer'lonii, Kisk'egauw'eqhi, Marag'aliphil'eduo, Pommo'icuote'nlerme, Vornu'wuzi'lerdim</p>"

Their bodies are denser than most humanoids' and as a result they were heavier than their appearance would tend to indicate. Devaronians have silver-based blood, which appears thick and black when exposed. They possess a unique blood filtration and cleansing system which processes through two livers. Because their bodies are constantly cleansed of toxins and carcinogens, the species is highly resistant to poison. To this end, sulfur is used as a stimulant on Devaron to enhance speed and strength, because inhaling it causes the substance to enter the bloodstream rapidly. Their livers struggle to eliminate sulfur from their system, meaning that long-term use can be dangerous.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Devaronian males are driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the first opportunity to move on from one place to another; they are often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts. Female Devaronians, on the other hand, are content to remain in a single location, raising the young and running the government of Devaron. The males send money back to their homeworld to support their families, but otherwise hardly ever return. The females are content with this arrangement, as they tend to view the restless males as disruptive to home life. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Devaronian names are dark, complex and often guttural, with some harsher tones mixed in here and there.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Cir, Gremegris, Keirtihk, Kucx, Niruhk</p>\r\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Crilnuy, Ghal, Milma, Nola, Taoluel </p>\r\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Breiz, Droddost, G'vaulnel, Raokt</p>"

Most Ewoks have solid-colored fur, though a few sport stripes. Ewoks have large, bright eyes, small humanoid noses, and hands that possess two fingers and an opposable thumb. Despite their small size, Ewoks are physically strong enough to overpower combat-trained Humans. Their appearance has been likened to \"little bears,\" though they are sometimes referred to as \"mini Wookiees.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Most Ewoks live high among the trees of the forest moon, in villages built between the closely spaced trees. The basic design of a tree village has a \"Central Village\" of thatched-roof huts on the primary limbs. These huts are high enough above the ground to be out of reach of predators. Suspended bridges connect the gaps between trees, adjoining distant huts. Knotted rope ladders allow access up or down.</p>\r\n<p>Ewoks enjoy singing and playing music during celebrations and rituals.

Males tended to have less skin variation and had a greater tendency towards dark green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure to the radiation of the Gamorr Star.

While the warlord and his boars are solely concerned with preparing and participating in battle with rival clans, the matrons of the clan performed all the productive work including farming, hunting, manufacturing, and running businesses.

They come in two sexes, male and female, and give birth to live young. They are bipedal beings with a bilateral symmetry, having a front and a back end, as well as an upside and downside. Their bodies are comprised of a torso with a head and four limbs attached to it. The upper limbs, or arms, end in hands which had five fingers each; the lower ones, called legs, end in feet. The human fingers have multiple points of articulation, and one of them is an opposable thumb that allowed for fine manipulation. Finally, they have one head perched atop their torso. Many other species, including twi'leks, mon calamari, or zabraks, are referred to as \"humanoids\" because of their structural resemblance to humans.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Humans can occupy a variety of employs, from politicians to bounty hunters, swoop racers, smugglers, or even a farmer. There exist many planetary groups of humans with their own cultures, such as the Alderaanians or the Pamarthens.

They possess distinctive faces: large, round, multifaceted eyes; tapir-like snouts; and a pair of saucer-shaped antennae on their heads, which served to detect vibrations. The flexible snouts augmented the rodians' finely tuned olfactory senses, collecting and filtering the air. Their characteristically large eyes indicated a primarily nocturnal ancestry and were capable of seeing into the infrared part of the spectrum. Due to their love of fighting and active lifestyles, most rodians kept in good condition, normally lean and wiry; however, some wealthy rodians became complacent and obese.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Rodian culture is obsessed with violence and death, due to behaviors and practices that are ingrained since their earliest ancestry. Their densely packed jungle homeworld is ill-suited for agriculture, requiring rodians to compete with vicious predators for most of their food, some of which can wipe out entire rodian villages. As the rodians developed cunning hunting tactics to survive, the hunt became central to their culture.

Sith have a larger than average number of individuals with potential to use the Force in their species, so high in fact that the entire species was considered strongly Force-sensitive. </p>\r\n<p>Sith purebloods are characterized by their expressive facial appendages, bone spurs, cranial horns, and predatory gaze.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Sith culture is a rigid and stratified caste-based society. For the sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Though they are in an almost constant state of war, their civilization is quite sophisticated; they see these acts not as cruel or barbaric, but simply basic aspects of existence. Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Sith pureblood names are not conventional. They are often named for virtues in the Sith tongue. Sith rarely share surnames, since they do not value family ties. When a sith pureblood achieves a success or victory, they often change their name to match their perceived newfound status. Since Force-sensitivity is common in sith purebloods, and their culture is built around strength, most sith are called simply \"My Lord,\" or some other epithet, by their underlings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Aqorzum, Khashai, Sihmot, Wirjol</p>\r\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Aqurwia, Cliriu, Nupax, Ubhesosiuth</p>"

Cold-blooded reptiles, trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see far into the infrared range. Each of their four limbs ends in three razor sharp claws. These are perfect for combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity, making a trandoshan's finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward. </p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Trandoshans worship their goddess, the Scorekeeper, whom they would appease through acts which increased their Jagannath points. This is done by living a lifestyle which was, by non-trandoshan standards, overtly aggressive, leading many trandoshans to become bounty hunters, mercenaries, or slavers. Trandoshans especially prize wookiee pelts, which consequently play a large part in earning Jagannath points-capturing the pelts of particularly infamous wookiees would give the hunter a large increase in Jagganath points. To be shamed or captured during a hunt would zero one's Jagganath points-effectively making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper. They could, however, win all those points back by killing the one who zeroed their score.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Trandoshan names are quite harsh and contain a lot of elongated sounds, as well as a lot of s's.

This, combined with their hostility to outsiders and Tatooine's remote and arid nature, makes even study of Tusken corpses difficult.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Tuskens are a primative, tribal race, mostly living in small clans scattered throughout Tatooine's deserts. Due to the harsh and unforgiving desert environment, Tusken clans are often xenophobic and territorial, but it is not unknown for them to adopt members of other species into the clan. They believe that all water is sacred and promised to them alone, and are infamous among the other residents of Tatooine for raiding and pillaging settlements and farms.</p>\r\n<p>Tusken clans are usually very stratified, with males as hunters and warriors, while females and children maintain the camp. Tusken warriors hold their bond with their gaderffii weapons and Bantha mounts as sacred, and will choose death before relinquishing either.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Tusken naming traditions vary between clans, but most are made up of harsh, guttural sounds.

A number of twi'leks believe that slavery is an efficient way to proliferate their species and preserve their culture, as the twi'leks lack their own means of inter-planetary travel. Regardless of how it came about, many twi'leks live as slaves or entertainers and are considered status symbols, especially the females of rarer skin hues.

This pheromonal language can not be understood by any other species, or even by Weequays of another clan. Only Jedi senses can even tell that two Weequay are communicating. Since each Weequay's pheromones are unique, Weequay have no need for a name within their clan.

When they returned, they shaved their braids. Weequays serving the Hutts were often very close to their homeworld, and would only have one or two braids. Female Weequay were usually bald, and did not follow this tradition.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Only Weequay who have to live among other clans, or among non-Weequay, take a personal name.

Therefore, their notion of \"family\" encompassed much more than just blood ties. A part of that most sacred tradition was the social institution of life debt: when a wookiee's life was saved by someone else, regardless of the species, they would frequently devote themselves to a lifetime of service to their savior and their family. Through the mechanism of the life debt, the People of the Trees used to develop unbreakable bonds with their boon companions and true friends, forming a \"honor family.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Wookiee names are diverse; some names are simple and short while others are long and complicated.

The most striking of these are a series of vestigial horns that crown the heads of both males and females. These horns grow at puberty in varying patterns and signified that their rite of passage is drawing near.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to their horns, another of the traits that make zabrak instantly recognizable are their facial tattoos, which are made up of thin lines received during their rite of passage. These could symbolize many things, including but not limited to family lineage, place of birth, or even a design that reflected their individual personalities.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, zabraks possess a second heart.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Zabrak are often seen by most other species as being single-minded, an observation that is not terribly incorrect. This single-minded determination comes from the fact that they are a species with a strong sense of self-assuredness, confident that they are able to accomplish any task that they set out to do. However, this does not lead a zabrak to develop a sense of prideful superiority towards others. Though it is not uncommon to see competition between colonies, this is not seen as a negative. The zabraks believe that the various experiences of the different colonies only serve to add to the species' overall value throughout the galaxy.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Zabrak names are usually derived from the animals living on their planet.

All cells in the abyssin body are replaced every 80 hours, and organs which typically were paired in other species appear singularly.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>A primitive tribal society, the abyssin of Byss are known as violent and brutish, and their planet is avoided by most beings in the civilized galaxy. Unstable resources on Byss do not allow for mass population growth or for the stabilization of a central government, economy or trade system. </p>\r\n<p>Existing simply in nomadic tribes, abyssin groups can interact peacefully with one another, though only if both groups have plentiful water and food supplies. Otherwise, they began a 'Blooding', a brawl that ends only when one tribe's warriors are all killed, captured, or incapacitated. Warriors who survive a Blooding are usually allowed to join the winning tribe once they finish their regeneration. This tradition led to some violent incidents when spacers tried to make first contact and trade with Abyssin tribes with scarce water resources, especially since the abyssin assumed the alien traders could regenerate as quickly as they did. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>There does not appear to be any distinction between male and female names for abyssin.

Evolving into a class of reptomammal, advozsec have a single horn at the crown of their heads, four digits on each hand and foot, pointed ears, and large eyes. Advozsec are strictly vegetarian, unable to properly digest meat. The geothermal hot springs that appear on their homeworld forced the species to evolve thick skin in order to survive. The large eyes of the advozsec are adaptations to the clouds of volcanic ash which darken Riflor's skies. </p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Since so much of the sunlight on Riflor is blocked by volcanic eruptions, advozsec tend to settle near geothermal springs for heat. Unfortunately, these springs also tend to be in geologically unstable regions, and anything built near them is often destroyed or abandoned due to eruptions or groundquakes. As a result, the advozse people ended up having little attachment to material goods or long-term plans, and developed a pessimistic, selfish, and even paranoid outlook on life. This facet of their culture remained long after contact with the Galactic Republic gave them access to modern construction techniques allowing for more permanent buildings. Seeing financial stability as the only truly achievable stability one could find in life, the advozsec constantly strive to accumulate as much monetary wealth as they can in a lifetime in order to have the ability to rebuild when the worst happens.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Advozsec have simple names that do not distinguish between genders, using familiar surnames.</p>\r\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Dleck, Fjemm, Gorde, Rollar, Xon</p>\r\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Ghantere, Leventraim, Timack, Vy, Zimda</p>"

                    "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\r\n<p>The aing-tii are a species of sentient, toothless mammals who stand on two clawed feet with two spindly arms, each with three large digits. Their bodies are covered in jointed white, bony plates covered in unique painted motifs. The aing-tii head is small and juts out perpendicularly from their chest, featuring two large eyes and six long, thin, green tongues extending from their mouths. They have a long, prehensile tail. The species is incapable of producing sound and conveys information via tasting, smelling and touching each other with their tongues.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>The aing-tii are native to a planet whose location in the Kathol Rift is a closely guarded secret. Although in a dangerous area of space, the majority of Aing-Tii never leave their homeworld nor have any contact with the outside world. Those who do—commonly called aing-tii warrior monks—are often xenophobic and reclusive. The monks spend their entire lives performing errands for their gods, in the hope that they will receive \"an answer\" from them. The aing-tii hate slavery, and often attack slavers who roam the Kathol Outback.</p>\r\n<p>While the aing-tii are Force-sensitive, they avoid wielding the Force, which they see as sacred. The aing-tii believe that everything is somehow guided by the Force. They do not believe in the light or dark sides of the Force. Instead, they hold that there are many different aspects to the Force.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Aing-tii names are, in reality, non-verbal and only truly understandable via taste, smell, and touch.  The few aing-tii who have been known to the outside world have used translators to convey an auditory identifier. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Ben'Sur, Looshen'Fel, Tadar'Ro</p>\r\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Kulan'Pa, Laman'So, Te'Nuriel </p>"

The fingers are paired in twos and slightly spaced apart from the others. The eyes of the anomids are solid, with no visible irises or pupils and have been seen in varying shades of yellow or blue.

These are not breath masks, but vocalizer units. Since anomids have no vocal cords, they rely on these vocalizer masks to communicate with other species. These masks are often elaborately customized to reflect an anomid's social status, family origin, or profession. Among themselves, anomids communicate using an elaborate sign language.

These facial tusks are highly sensitive to heat and cold and are used for cracking open the hard shells of shellfish or burrowing through the swampy loam of their homeworld. Having finned hands and two bulbous black eyes, Aqualish are unable to manipulate most machinery or equipment developed by the galaxy's many species which designed these tools for beings with digits. As a result, Aqualish tend to remain on their homeworld. Aqualish are well known for their hair-trigger tempers that flare without reason.</p>\r\n<p>While Force-sensitive Aqualish are rare, members of the species have trained as both Sith and Jedi, though they typically gravitate toward the former.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>The Aqualish hate the image they have in the galaxy as thugs, regardless of its veracity, and blame it on any- and everyone else. Because of this, the species are considered pariahs on Ando, which has a lower population of Aqualish than the galaxy itself. All Aqualish speak mutually intelligible dialects of the same language. Quarrelsome and thug-like, the Aqualish culture revolved around aggression and toughness, with diplomacy being one of their weakest attributes.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Aqualish names are intended to sound strong.

Cona is always hot, and has very little water, but the atmosphere is filled with ammonia vapor. Arcona adapted to this environment by eating the ammonia-converting roots of flora as a source of water. Arcona depended on the ammonia to live and, as a result, arcona living offworld have to take ammonia supplements. Despite their large eyes, arcona have very poor eyesight. Their eyes, made up of thousands of photoreceptors, can not detect fine shapes, only seeing blurry objects. To aid this, they have a small sensory organ between their eyes. Often mistaken for their nose, this organ detects heat patterns from living beings. Thus, arcona can recognize things by its heat pattern.</p>\r\n<p>Arcona are highly susceptible to addiction to spice and common salt, which serves as a hallucinogen with effects resembling that of intoxication. Their eyes shift to gold after prolonged addiction.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Arcona normally think of themselves not as individuals but as a collective whole. Largely forsaking individuality, they often refer to themselves as \"we\" even when alone. The arcona live in loose, family-based communities called nests, which are ruled by a Grand Nest. Because arcona are born in nests underground, they obtain a close sense of family living in close quarters with siblings. Males raise the young, since females are typically impulsive thrill-seekers. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Arcona names are quite diverse, named by their fathers in the nest.

Retractable, these atennapalps allow them to listen into the subsonic range and give the species physical intuition and preternatural reflexes, which members of the Jedi Order sometimes mistook for Force-sensitivity. Balosars also possess an acute tolerance for poisonous substances, a byproduct of life on their toxic homeworld.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Early in its history, the balosar homeworld was overrun by galactic megacorporations eager to exploit the world's lax ecological protection laws.

After its discovery, Balosar was wrought with corruption, addiction, and pollution from the production and usage of death sticks.</p>\r\n<p>Since there is little opportunity to flourish on their homeworld, balosars often leave in search of fortune elsewhere. Their natural resistance to the lethal—but not the addictive—effects of the drug encourages some to enter the death stick business.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Balosar names have a slight exotic tinge to them—often because Balosar parents name their children while on a death stick high.

They are well known for their aggression but are also extremely loyal.

Baragwin generally have little prejudice, treating all other beings equally regardless of species, culture, or planetary origins; though criminal baragwin will exploit all beings equally instead. Baragwin settlements are generally small and anarchic, with short-term leaders selected by informal democratic processes. Baragwin are famous as skilled weapon-smiths and introduced many different weapons to different worlds. Baragwin-made blasters and vibroblades are among the most powerful personal weapons in the galaxy. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Baragwin have names with wide tones, spoken using the entire mouth, that don't differentiate by gender. Baragwin use familial surnames.</p>\r\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Dagel, Eskaul, Idalli, Migo</p>\r\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Fadani, Igara, Kodrue, Wylbas</p>"

The communes have a strict policy of keeping the size of their groupings equal to avoid conflict. When too many families grow in one area, the leader would ask certain families to break away and start a new community on another glacier.</p>\r\n<p>While not involved in galactic politics and because they do not produce any of their own technology, the Besalisks established large orbital space stations where offworlders could come to do business.

Even after they gained access to galactic technology, they continued to live as nomads (though more affluent Chevin mounted their lodges on large repulsorlift vehicles instead.) Their Chev slaves are usually forced to follow on foot. Nomadic groups of Chevin keep in touch via comlinks, and often converge on a single location to deal with danger.</p>\r\n<p>The only Chevin settlements that stay in place for more than one standard month are the Government Villages, where Chevin dictators live with their hand-picked advisors. Even these settlements are movable when necessary.

These horns start as small knobs covered by red-furred velvet: a vascular tissue. Once the knobs have grown sufficiently, they break through the velvet naturally, emerging as transparent horns, as bright as diamond, cool to the touch and with smooth ridges. However, if the velvet is cut artificially, chironians can die from the injury. Over time, the horns grow long and sharp enough that adolescent chironians can use them to gore opponents.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Chironians express emotions through the mannerisms of their hooves: when impatient, they stamp them; when excited, they tap them in a quick dance, or canter in a spot. The centauriforms frequently shake their heads and manes, and when angry, their faces flush a deeper shade. Young chironians, when frightened, are known to rub or press their velvet-covered horns against the foreheads of other beings to whom they are emotionally close.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Chironian names are soft and melodic, despite the thick nature of their native language.

Codru-Ji in this stage of their lives are called Wyrwulves: they mature to their more recognizable figures after reaching puberty.

A colicoid's physiology allows them to curl up into a protective ball and unfurl suddenly which allow them to catch their prey unaware. This rolling method of locomotion is second nature to the colicoids. Their insectoid minds provide them a natural defense against mind tricks. </p>\r\n<p>Some members are colicoid queens that are different as they are more than twice the size of even the largest warrior breeds.

However, a queen tends to only fight when her young are being threatened.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Though highly intelligent, colicoids are emotionless and cannibalistic in nature. Their ruthless cunning serves them well on the battlefield as it does on the negotiating table. It is known that long ago that they transferred these ruthless characteristics to their commerce activities. As a result, they are known to be brutally efficient in their business practices.

The Draethos' culture is warrior-based, and those living on the homeworld are expected to demonstrate their martial or hunting prowess. Life on Draethos is harsh, with arrogant aristocrats squabbling among one another for social standing and wealth. Warriors are perpetually in high demand as gladiators, mercenaries, hunters, and soldiers. Those who make a conscious decision to abandon the way of the warrior are exiled to seek a new life among aliens.

Their primary means of locomotion is their strong arms, and their lower limbs and feet were used for grappling and other fine motor manipulation. They hardly ever walk on their lower limbs. Although most Dugs may walk on all four limbs, others like to use their strong arms as legs and their feet as hands like they would normally do.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Due to their oppression under their Gran rulers who colonized Malastare, many Dugs often feel the need to throw around their strength in bids to establish dominance. As a result, they are known for their ill-tempered demeanor, and many are bullying thugs.</p>\r\n<p>On their homeworld of Malastare, the vast majority of Dugs are little more than laborers toiling for the enrichment of the Gran. With the species excluded from much of the power and money on Malastare, many Dugs turn to swoop racing or bounty hunting as their only means to achieve fame and fortune. In all other areas, the Dugs are exploited.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Dug names are often 3 syllables long, mostly through big sounds rather than harsh tones. There are harsher tones in their names as well though, often in the forms of x's and k's. Female Dugs have softer names, but no one would call them beautiful.

The natural armor allow the Gand to shrug off injuries that would cripple most other species. The exoskeleton provides extra protection in the clavicle region, which prevented most nerve or pressure-point strikes to the neck and shoulders. In addition, Gands have the remarkable ability to regrow lost limbs. If a Gand is dismembered, it can regrow a lost limb in a few days. </p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Gand society places heavy importance on the achievements of an individual and holds that an individual has no name, and thus no worth, until he or she proves otherwise. The speech patterns of Gands utilize third-person self-reference within each level of identity earned. Young or unproven Gands are all called \"Gand,\" as they are considered merely aspects of the same whole. Major accomplishments earn the use of a family surname. Mastering a skill, such as becoming a findsman, allows for the use of the given name, all with third-person self-reference. This manner of speaking is common within the spoken and written Gand language but is more predominant when a Gand speaks Basic; it is often a source of amusement to outsiders.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Until a Gand has earned the use of a name, they go simply by the term \"Gand.\" Gand speak in the third person and refer to themselves by name. Often, when a Gand feels shamed, they will stop referring to themselves by their name and revert to calling themselves \"Gand\" until they prove themselves again.

Their senses also pick up the electromagnetic auras from other life forms. When close to their hunting targets, they can ascertain information on its mood, awareness, and state of mind. Electronic devices can also be sensed by Gotals; in fact, most droids give off enough electromagnetic emissions to at least annoy a Gotal, and at worst to seriously disorient the horned beings, making them notoriously distrustful of droids.

A single meal can take almost an entire day to finish, after that a Gran does not often need to eat for several days.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>The peaceful nature of Gran society is a reflection of their homeworld, Kinyen. Kinyen boasted large and rolling grasslands and highlands, a dense and beautiful forest, and one of the longest and clearest rivers in the Bes Ber Bikade sector. The beauty of this planet, and the need for primitive Gran to band together for defense against predatory animals, helped the Gran develop strong bonds of home and family in their society. </p>\r\n<p>The Grans are also very protective of their families, and were some of the most devoted parents in the galaxy.

Natural explorers and traders, they sailed the cosmos establishing crucial trade routes and gaining prestige. Despite their size, herglic are surprisingly dexterous while working with tools, and are some of the finest engineers in the galaxy. </p>\r\n<p>Herglics have an inquisitive but practical nature, enjoying travel and having exotic experiences. Their perpetually calm demeanor  helps them interact with most other species peacefully, though when dealing with smaller species, herglics tend to become nervous and self-conscious about their proportions. They also seem to have an innate predilection for gambling and games of chance, which have gotten more than one herglic into trouble on several occasions.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Male names are typically harsher sounding than female names.

The ho'din have an aversion to technology and avoid surface mining and manufacturing, opting instead to dwell in trees.

Kallerans are tall and flexible; their hands and feet have three prehensile digits on each, which leeds kallerans to avoid wearing shoes or boots. The majority of kallerans have green skin patterned with distinctive black stripes. The species have dense muscles that assist them in the protection of their otherwise delicate bodies. The kalleran head is distinguished by fin-like folds on the tops and sides of their faces. These fins augment a kalleran's hearing, allowing sound to bounce back and be picked up by the two antenna crowning their head. These antenna are sensory organs that serve as olfactory and aural receptors. Kallerans have lungs adapted to breathe above water, though the majority of their respiration is done through their skin. A holdover from their amphibious past, their skin can draw oxygen in from the air and filter out carbon dioxide. Their respiratory system requires them to consume more water than other species their size to keep their skin moist and supple. Because they do not primarily breathe through their mouths, kallerans did not evolve noses.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Above all else, kalleran's value personal achievement over collective accomplishments.

To them any species seeking self-improvement is worthy of respect, but those who do not are obviously inferior; self-improvement has a central role in Kaminoan society.

                    "value": "<h2>Biology and Appearance</h2>\r\n<p>Kubaz are distinctive for their short, prehensile facial snouts which were used for reaching insects within their hives. They have adapted to their sun-scorched, vegetation-deprived world by learning to survive off their world's native insect population. Filled with two rows of teeth for gnashing their food, the Kubaz trunk also functions as a highly sensitive nose.  Due to living on their homeworld of Kubindi—a planet which orbits a blue star—Kubaz are highly sensitive to red wavelengths; when traveling to planets with a red or yellow star, Kubaz are forced to don protective eyewear to avoid damaging their sensitive eyes.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>The Kubazi society is based on a clan structure which dwell in underground nests. Ruled by a queen, each clan takes the name of their queen they are descended from. Developing a non-verbal language of hand gestures which indicated their intentions, Kubaz are able to speak Galactic Basic, though with a strong nasally accent.  When interacting with other species, some Kubaz will share certain hand signals with non-Kubaz in order to ease communications.  Obsessed with tact and decorum, the Kubaz place a high emphasis on the family unit and proper courtesies, displaying truthfulness to a fault. Valuing art and literature with such vigor as to sometimes practice smuggling of great works, the Kubaz do not find such pursuits to be wrong or unlawful.  Due to their diet on Kubindi, the Kubaz have poor relations with sentient insectile species. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Kubaz names are usually dominated by harsher sounds, but some names lean more melodic. Surnames are clan-based.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Shaf, Rizor, Duldril, Kurn, Schnaldiz</p>\r\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Zhanro, Dizi, Tavo, Agoz, Nuzrem</p>\r\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Re, Eadzan, Hai, Khu'nar, Mairvuc, Va</p>"

They can walk either upright on their two legs, and can also use their arms and legs for faster movement. Many lurmen have the ability to roll themselves into a wheeled shape; this allows them to cover distances at great speed. They may have learned this ability from the native amani on Maridun. </p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>The lurmen use fallen seedpods from the giant trees as shelter and home. Living near the trees proves too dangerous, as the falling pods can be deadly. Instead, the lurmen drag the pods into a clearing and use them as huts. They also extract essential oils from the pods for nutrition and healing medicines. Most lurmen are pacifistic by nature and refuse to fight or run even in the face of death. They often will hide instead of using violence. As pacifists, they carry no weapons but carry farming tools or ropes. The greatest native threat to the lurmen are the amani and the mastiff phalones, raptor-headed quadrupeds that hunted in groups. However, even in defeating these beasts the lurmen attempt to remain true to their pacifist ideals, and not inflict any injury to the creatures. Instead, when cornered by a mastiff phalone, an agile lurmen will try to unbalance the creature by tying a rope around its stout legs. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Lurmen names are sharp and made up of a single syllable.

Their eyes also have pupils that split horizontally, and they are distinguished by small lumps on their foreheads and down-turned mouths. Instead of noses, they have olfactory glands underneath their eyes. These genetic differences are attributed to the distinct features of their homeworld, Neimoidia, including its gravity, which is markedly heavier than duro.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Neimoidians spend their formative years as puny grubs in the communal hives of Neimoidia, until the age of seven standard years. They are knowingly neglected by being given limited amounts of food. This way, the weaker individuals are weeded out, while the most acquisitive grubs hoard more food than they can eat by themselves. Neimoidian education ensures the survival of the greediest. Neimoidians place tremendous value on wealth and material possessions, and would go to great lengths to gain money and power. This has resulted in a stereotype of neimoidians being greedy and cowardly. While not all neimoidians are easily intimidated, many prefer to avoid direct combat.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Neimoidian names are usually short and easy to pronounce, to make them more memorable to other species that approach them as consumers.

They hold a limited range of facial expressions because they lack the necessary anatomical infrastructure. Their eyes are covered by a protective membrane, being a thin transparent pellicle that protects their eyes underwater and during windstorms. As a result, they are noted for their \"staring\" eyes and a seemingly blank expression which leads to many underestimating nikto intelligence.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Although lacking in personal charisma, nikto posses a single-minded tenacity that makes them excellent followers. Their lives made nikto cunning combatants. Most nikto are content with a life of servitude as in their eyes a life in slavery was preferable to the hardship and toil on their homeworld. Not all nikto work for the hutts though most free members of their kind were formerly enslaved. Whilst nikto are known to escape from their master, most tend to fall into service of another hutt who \"inherited\" them according to custom should their previous employer die. However, some escaped nikto did instead use some opportunities to genuinely become free beings. Any such emancipated nikto have to be constantly on guard as they risked capture by hutt-employed slavers who return their prey to their \"rightful owners\". In addition, they lacked charisma and preferred to follow orders instead of giving them. As a result, the Nikto were most identified with their Hutt masters.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Nikto names are very complex, hard to pronounce, and harsh sounding. Name length also differs a lot, longer names having apostrophes or dashes. Their names are unisex, with surnames being familiar and optional. </p>\r\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Jydabaum, N'rok'ratu, Sussa, Vydgish</p>\r\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Gozorc, Irtitt, Qegmarg, Umpluurg</p>"

They possess floppy ears, which are extremely sensitive to sound waves. They have two hands, each ending in four chubby fingers and a thumb, which is not opposable. A thick, baggy hide covered in fuzz resembling velvet hangs off of the Ortolan body. Ortolans have a keen sense of smell to help them forage for food. In fact, they are handicapped in their business affairs by their attachment to food, sometimes accepting otherwise unfavorable contracts when promised enough to eat. Their twin obsessions are food and music; offworld, many Ortolans find success as chefs or musicians. </p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Ortolan society is reasonably industrialised, though not as technologically advanced as other species. Despite this, their economy is mostly based on barter, with credits primarily used to trade with offworlders. Education is the responsibility of their parents, though gifted youngsters are often traded to other families to get specialized education. </p>\r\n<p>While most Ortolans appear to have blue skin, Ortolans are actually covered in short velvety fur which they often dyed in bright colors, most often blue and pink.  This tradition began when a Devaronian trader tried to sell Ortolans a shipment of food dyes—they considered dyeing their food a waste of time, but found dyed fur to be quite stylish.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Ortolan names are generally short with big sounds.

The species has pale, wrinkled skin, due to the fact that they lived in the sinkholes of Utapau, giving them limited access to light. These traits cause some to view them as frightening. However, Pau'ans as a society are generally friendly, and are happy to welcome guests to their often overlooked world. Pau'ans have long lifespans, living up to 700 years, much longer than the Utai. This earned them the nickname of \"Ancients\".</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Pau'ans fulfill most of the governmental and administrative duties on Utapau, as the utai do not desire such work, serving as laborers instead. Most pau'ans served as leaders early in their lives, often managing teams of Utai laborers. This gives them experience that will be used later in their lives. Pau'ans are kind leaders, and sympathetic to their subordinates. Each city on Utapau is controlled by a Master of Port Administration, a hereditary title reserved for pau'ans. These administrators are assisted by advisory councils for making important decisions about their city, and each administrator serves on the Utapauan Committee and oversees planetary governance. However, the committee rarely makes crucial decisions, as the cities are able to function on their own most of the time.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Pau'an names are fairly simple, and generally melodic.

These bipedal beings have three digit hands that are tipped with claws for digging through packed dirt. As a species, they are uniformly lean and tall; while most rakata have a similar height and weight, females tend to be more slender than males, though just as tall. Rakata are primarily carnivorous, likely stemming from the fact that they are cannibalistic, often making a meal of other species.</p>\r\n<p>Long term abuse of the Force in their society, exacerbated by a plague, culled the rakata's ability to sense the Force.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Rakatan technology and structures hold the unique property of blending with the Force, creating powerful and long-lasting monuments that are almost impossibly to replicate. Rakatan society is devoted to conquering and enslaving those they deem weak. At the height of its power, the Rakatan Infinite Empire had conquered and enslaved dozens of worlds. They would strip entire planets of their resources and then terraform them to fit their own needs.</p>\r\n<p>After a plague ravaged their civilization and caused the fall of the Infinite Empire, rakata broke off into smaller tribes rather than a unified organization. Despite their newfound tribal nature, rakata retained their ability to quickly adapt to and appropriate technology.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Rakatan names do not distinguish by gender, and they do not use surnames.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Names.</strong> Ceh'let, Orsaa, Skal'nas, Soa, Tul'kar</p>"

The wings grant the Rishii the ability to fly at great speeds, which is their method of travel equivalent to running in land-based species.

Rishii were capable of mimicking anything said to them perfectly, and also possessed extremely strong senses, particularly hearing and sight. </p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Native to the planet Rishi, the Rishii live in loose primitive tribes, known as nests, clustered high upon the planet's mountains, away from the hot and humid lowland swamps. Each nest consists of a small number of family units led by a chieftain, with neighbouring nests respecting each others territories and living in harmony. This peaceful and accepting attitude goes beyond just other Rishii and was extended to all neighbours of a nest, including the many other species who colonise the lowlands of Rishi. Due to the unfavorable conditions found in the lowlands, the native avians do not understand the off-worlders' choice to live there, but were not opposed to their presence.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>As with much of their speech, Rishii names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them.

They claim that sabaac, the popular card game that took the place of Pazaak in terms of card game prominence, is derived from their use of it as a fortune telling tool in their auguries.

Their heads resemble sting rays and they have a blue, pink, or green skin naturally patterned as an underwater camouflage. Their mouths are bracketed by cephalic lobes. Female Selkath differed from males due to the presence of tendrils on the back of their heads.</p>\r\n<p>All members of the Selkath race have rectractable, venom-tipped claws. The use of these claws in any form of combat or attack was considered dishonorable and a sign of madness; to do this was to give in to animal instincts unbecoming of a sentient species. Because of the Selkath's water-dwelling nature, their chest armors were fitted with misting vents in order to keep their skin moist.</p>\r\n<h2>Society & Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Selkath are native to the planet Manaan, the only naturally occurring source of the medical liquid referred to as kolto. The Selkath have leveraged this monopoly on maintain their neutrality, peddling their invaluable healing supplies to all comers.</p>\r\n<p>Manaan is an ocean planet is home to only one above-surface settlement, the floating Ahto City, built directly above Hrakert Rift, the most abundant source of kolto on Manaan.  As bacta began to replace the inferior kolto on the galactic stage, Manaan fell from their previously respected position, shirking away their previous prestige and causing many Selkath to disappear from the galactic eye into isolationism and tribalism. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Selkath names tend to have a flowing quality to it, like a stream of water. They rarely use surnames.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Chata, Galas, Qual, Morgo, Shaelas</p>\r\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Halsuna, Dolmas, Shasa, Ulsuru</p>"

The species colonized all the unpopulated worlds in the Uvena system to prevent them from being settled by non-Shistavanen, and their restrictive trade laws (which are unapologetic in how they favor their own kind over off-world traders).  Most of their society uses technology similar to the rest of the galaxy, though some parts of Uvena Prime use slightly less sophisticated technology.</p>\r\n<p>A minority of Shistavanen are more outgoing, and travel the galaxy's hyperlanes. Even these Shistavanen usually remain by themselves or with other Shistavanen.

Their pink skin is covered in fur that offers some protection from cold weather, but, more importantly, it serves as an olfactory organ, able to pick up scents at a distance and ascertain intrinsic details—such as penetrating through a disguise or identifying a forgery—when rubbed against. The species has both male and female sexes, although non-Squibs often have difficulty determining the sex of a Squib based on appearance alone. Their mouths are full of forbidding, sharp, white teeth, and their flexible cheeks were capable of storing items.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Squibs are friendly and cheerful to such an extent that, over time, they are considered quite annoying. Squibs are inherently curious, handling items with literal regard to care. They are unabashed pack rats, and they wear clothing for the excess storage rather than necessity. The Squibs' overconfidence is a defining trait. The typical Squib response to a threat is not to fight or flee, but to bluff and bluster, especially when not face-to-face. In person, their sharp teeth are their favored means of intimidation. Squibs believe that bargaining is the highest form of communication, and they believe haggling is more important than the goods themselves. A deal is a binding oath to Squibs, and they are incredibly loyal to their business partners.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Squibs combine their first and last names, which are familial, into one long, hyphenated name. They often go by nicknames derived from their full names. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Full Names.</strong> Galaneever-marmalios, Meelawin-demort, Sleerinwilpher-remalior</p>\r\n<p><strong>Nicknames.</strong> Galan, Meela, Wilpher</p>"

Their muscular forms combined with their powerful tails make them very agile hunters, and their colorfully-scaled hides have been proven to be resistant even to blaster bolts. From their nostrils, two scent-tongues protrude that grant them enhanced olfactory senses, compensating for the poor vision afforded them by their dark, three-lidded eyes. No Ssi-ruu has ever been known to be Force-sensitive.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>The citizens of the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium follow a rigid caste system in which their station in society is determined by the color of the scales they are born with. Among these, the brown-scaled outcasts are regarded as the lowest of the low, and have no place in the Imperium beyond menial labor or death at birth. Deeply xenophobic and religious, the Ssi-ruuk view the rest of the galaxy as populated by lesser beings whose worlds rightfully belong to the Imperium. Despite their fierce nature, most ssi-ruuk are afraid of dying on a world unconsecrated by their priest caste, as they believe their souls would be doomed, so they harvest and \"entech\" the life-energy of other species to power droids that fight for them. The entechment process is torturous and painful to its victims, and is the main power source of Ssi-ruuvi technology.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Ssi-ruuvi names are difficult to pronounce and gender neutral. Many ssi-ruuk adopt nicknames to make the lives of their associates easier. Ssi-ruuk do not have surnames.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Names.</strong> Firwirrung, Ivpikkis, Sh'tk'ith, Th'twirirl, Yifaii</p>"

Alternatively, during the deep darkness of their homeworld's moonless night, the larger pair are utilized to provide the Talz with adequate vision. Talz use a small proboscis to eat and communicate, creating high-pitched chirps and buzzes.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Talz are a hunter-gatherer, clan-based society.

Tarasins also have a colorful fan of flesh and scales—known as a kampo—that opens around their heads when they experience strong emotional distress, which can be a detriment to negotiations, as it is difficult for a tarasin to hide discomfort. This color-changing ability is useful for camouflage and communication, and the scales naturally repel heat. Some examples of colors they take on include being brown when calm and in a comfortable environment, or becoming red after extended exertion or when excited. Tarasins also have short spines that protrude from their forearms—known as a sa'tosin—which give the creatures the ability to sense the use of the Force. Tarasins are naturally curious and protective but also slow to anger. What they lack in sheer physical strength they make up for with a brilliant intellect.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Tarasins live in a tribal system in the jungle underbrush of Cularin, grouping together in clans called irstat. The tarasin believe they have a symbiotic relationship with Cularin, and their religion is based around the appreciation of the natural world. This closeness with their homeworld is what makes the tarasin reluctant to leave it for an extended time. The tarasin have a strong connection with the Force, and their spiritual leaders are often able to call upon the Force in small ways. The tarasin believe that the ch'hala tree is sacred.

These tails are very strong and are commonly used to carry large objects. When meditating or at rest, a thisspiasian will coil their tail beneath their torso, reducing their height by several feet. They also possess four arms, with the upper set being stronger and larger. Each of their four hands have five fingers, and each finger is tipped with a long, sturdy claw. It is thought unsophisticated or unseemly by upper-class thisspiasians to have the bottom two visible in public, so they are generally hidden from sight via larger garments, with the smaller limbs sometimes even bound to their bodies. Thisspiasians need very little sleep to function normally, resting for only two hours a day, with brief meditative moments scattered throughout the day to refocus.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Thisspiasian culture is one of proud warriors who keep their emotions well-concealed and their rages checked. Many outsiders see only a thisspiasian's outward facade of tranquility, and to most being it seems as if thisspiasians existed in a sea of calm. This is far from the truth, however, as they are in truth a very passionate species below the surface. A thisspiasian who doesn't meditate as often as they should will often be prone to otherwise atypical emotional outbursts.</p>\r\n<p>Thisspias is ruled by a hereditary leader called the Blood Monarch. Due to their seemingly archaic ruling structure, thisspiasians are often considered out-of-touch. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Thisspiasian names typically are composed of two similar sounding syllables. Surnames are familial. </p>\r\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Annak, Effed, Emmet, Gorro, Koto</p>\r\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Albarn, Braibel, Kirsingr, Raledurn</p>"

Yar Togna is a foul-smelling, high-gravity planet with a toxic, fume-saturated atmosphere. As a result, tognath wear a breathing apparatus to process the oxygen content in a planet's atmosphere. The tognath have a striking look thanks to their insectoid and mammalian characteristics; another factor is their having both an endo- and exoskeleton. They also possess a very primitive nervous system, which provides them with immunity to most pain (a helpful trait in combat). Tognath begin life as larvae born from egg clutches hatched in a suspension jelly, and latch onto one of their parents, feeding directly from their bloodstream. While in that jelly, two or more eggs (not necessarily from the same parent) sometimes graft together, thus creating a bond that continues throughout the life of the eggmates. Six months later, parents visit a nursery tree, where the young detatch from them and spin a cocoon. Within, the offspring undergo a metamorphosis, developing both their skeletons to resist the high gravity and pressures of Yar Togna.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Tognath live in stilted homes with lava channels near the main mountain range of Yar Togna, where they have access to mountain springwater. Most of tognath society believes that mate selection and egg laying should occur late in life, after having dedicated most of one's prime years to a career. This means that parents are generally retired and dote on their children relentlessly, often homeschooling them after their transformation. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Tognath use generally simple, nongendered names, without bothering with surnames.</p>\r\n<p><strong>First Names.</strong> Darjia, Essec, Irion, Tathak</p>"

This division has continued into modern times, with males continuing their nomadic traditions and females frequently preferring to stay in villages and cities.

While their stubby legs can support their body weight, Toydarians' primary mode of locomotion was their use of the wings on their upper back. Though their wings can beat as fast as ten times a second, the effort burned up large amounts of energy, causing the species to need to replenish itself often through regularly eating mass quantities of food. In order to fuel this hyperactive metabolism, Toydarians eat concentrated foods and egg-seeds. Most of the bloodiest wars in their history were fought over food supplies. </p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Despite being ruled by the Hutts, the Toydarian people are able to govern themselves free of major outside intervention through the establishment of a feudal monarchy. A ruling king sits on the planet's throne, allowing vassals to form allegiances and have minor disputes to solve their own problems. The king makes sure to keep his vassals happy and to have their allegiance, but will occasionally encourage infighting to reveal the true character of the vassals and weed out treachery. </p>\r\n<p>Toydarians are known as shrewd businessmen.</p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Toydarian names are fairly simple and guttural, but a few harsher elements can be found here and there. Male names are generally shorter than female names. Female names always end in a vowel. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Dod, Nesteddo, Tul, Zloomroo</p>\r\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Fefiffe, Lenlibo, Nugni, Zoldibu</p>\r\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> Daab, Faabb, Kepo, Mitra, Vulba</p>"

Most Voss live peacefully in Voss-Ka, caring for their families, cultivating the wild plants and maintaining equipment for the Voss commandos in the war against the Gormak, although some Voss do live outside the capital city, such as the Voss Mystics who reside in the Shrine of Healing. The Voss are great lovers of art, and their architecture features a distinctive artistic style.

They possess two biological traits of note. The first is that they all produce potent pheromones, similar to the Falleen species, which enhanced their attractiveness and likeability. The second is a limited telepathic ability, used to project emotions onto others, as well as allowing them to read and even feel the emotions of others; some Zeltrons have been hired by the Exchange for this ability. Because of their telepathic ability, positive emotions such as happiness, love and pleasure are very important to them, while negative ones such as anger, fear, or depression are shunned.</p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>Zeltron culture is highly influenced by sexuality and the pursuit of pleasure in general. Most of their art and literature is devoted to the subject, producing some of the raciest pieces in the galaxy. Zeltrons are known to dress in wildly colorful or revealing attire. It's common to see Zeltrons wearing shockingly bright shades of neon colors in wildly designed bikinis, or nearly skin tight clothing of other sorts with bizarre color designs, patterns, and symbols. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Zeltron names often have an air of mystique to them, to evoke sensuality. For a Zeltron, a beautiful face is nothing without an equally beautiful name. It's not uncommon for a Zeltron to forsake their familial surname in favor of a more attractive-sounding one.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Marruc, Bahb, Rahulh, Demagol </p>\r\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Lyshaa, Dani, Vianna, Chantique </p>\r\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> D'Pow, Blue, Duare, Sapphire</p>"

Feline in appearance, the species possesses strong, angular features, with long fangs jutting from their jaws and claws extending from their hands. The Zygerrians' faces and their pointed ears are almost entirely covered with fur; males usually have more hair than females, with bands of fur growing on their cheeks. Male Zygerrians also display a number of bony spurs protruding from the chin, which females typically lack. Zygerrians usually have sallow complexions and are physically strong, but some suffer from obesity. </p>\r\n<h2>Society and Culture</h2>\r\n<p>A warlike species, the Zygerrians hold strength—both physical and mental—in great esteem, viewing it as a means to gain power and authority. They believe that it is the natural order of life for the strong to dominate the weak, so slavery is normal for the species, and a display of weakness could mean death or enslavement in their culture. Those who become their slaves are viewed as inferior by the Zygerrians.</p>\r\n<p>Zygerrian society is organized into clans and classes. They have a noble class, many members of which, despite their high status, pursue a career in the military. The Zygerrian government is a monarchy; female rulers hold the title of Queen, and males are addressed as Kings.</p>\r\n<p>The center of the Zygerrian society is the Zygerrian Slavers Guild, which focuses on the slave trade in the Outer Rim Territories. </p>\r\n<h2>Names</h2>\r\n<p>Zygerrian names are rather diverse, though shorter names are the most common. Surnames are familial.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Male Names.</strong> Agruss, Darts, Atai, Sono</p>\r\n<p><strong>Female Names.</strong> Miraj, Faralhi, Latrans, MaDall</p>\r\n<p><strong>Surnames.</strong> D'nar, Molec, Scientel, Thanda, Tyne</p>"
