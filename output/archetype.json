                "value": "<h1>Acquisitions Practice</h1>\r\n<p>Many operatives are hired for the procurement of valuable artifacts, but only the true masters of the art can slip through the tightest security and make off with untold riches, whether they do it for a profit, or for sport. Those operatives who choose the Acquisitions Practice apply a mixture of stealth and impressive acrobatics to surpass any kind of defenses they are met with.</p>\r\n<h2>Fast and Agile</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Acquisitions Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your demolitions kit or security kit to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, climbing no longer costs you extra movement, and you gain the ability to move in flying leaps with incredible speed, precision, and power. When you move, instead of using your walking speed, you may take two short movements by flying. Each movement is at half your speed, and you must end each one on a solid object, a surface, or on the ground. If you do not, you fall and your movement ends. If you Dash, your bonus movement is applied to your normal speed, not this movement. </p>\r\n<h2>Deft Hands</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Acquisitions Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn a number of techniques to distract and confuse your opponents. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to perform a deft hand maneuver.</p>\r\n<p>Some of your deft hand maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the deft hand maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is as follows:</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<p><strong>Deft Hands save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<h3>Hinder</h3>\r\n<p>You attempt to distract your target in order to hinder their movement. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn and it makes the first Dexterity saving throw before the end of its next turn with disadvantage.</p>\r\n<h3>Pilfer</h3>\r\n<p>You attempt to pick your target's pockets. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on the first Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check you make against the target before the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h3>Tumble</h3>\r\n<p>You attempt to nimbly roll away. You immediately move 10 feet in a direction of your choice, and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the creature.</p>\r\n<h2>Supreme Sneak</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Acquisitions Practice:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn. Additionally, as long as you aren't incapacitated, you no longer take damage from falling less than 100 feet, and have resistance to falling damage.</p>\r\n<h2>Aerial Agility</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Acquisitions Practice:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your agility in the air grants you the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>When you move, you can instead take 3 short movements by flying.</li>\r\n<li>Whenever you end your flying movement and you are within 5 feet of a climbable surface, you can grab onto that surface as though you were climbing upon it.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>Thief's Reflexes</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Acquisitions Practice:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you learn to utilize the momentum of your fall to make deadly vertical strikes. Whenever you fall at least 50 feet and land within 5 feet of an enemy creature you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against that creature. If the attack is a Sneak Attack, you can deal three additional weapon dice worth of damage and the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>"

You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.</p>\r\n<h3>Force Points</h3>\r\n<p>You have a number of force points equal to your operative level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\r\n<p>Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table.</p>\r\n<p>You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Forcecasting Ability</h3>\r\n<p>Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability.

Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, speaking glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it. Additionally, it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h2>Mesmerizing Presence</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Beguiler Practice:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures charmed by you.</p>\r\n<h2>Enthralling Vigor</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Beguiler Practice:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Whenever a creature fails a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw against a force power or class feature you use, you can gain temporary hit points equal to half your operative level (rounded down) + your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once).

On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your powers on your next turn.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h4>Beguiler Practice Forcecasting</h4>"

                "value": "<h1>Doctor Pursuit</h1>\r\n<p>Doctors study the medical, anatomical, and biological sciences. Those scholars who choose the Doctor Pursuit use their knowledge to mend their allies on the field and deal crippling blows with surgical precision.</p>\r\n<h2>Medical Practitioner</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Doctor Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain proficiency with biochemist's kits and your choice of the Medicine or Nature skills. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.</p>\r\n<h2>Remote Healer</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Doctor Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You have learned to deploy medicine from a range. When you use a maneuver targeting an ally that is the target of your Critical Analysis feature, that maneuver's range becomes 30 feet.</p>\r\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Doctor Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain access to new maneuvers which reflect the progress of your studies into the medical arts. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h3>Adrenaline Hit</h3>\r\n<p>You can use an action and expend one superiority die to inject a creature with regenerative medication that temporarily enhances their agility. When you do so, a creature you can touch regains hit points equal to the superiority die roll. Additionally, until the start of your next turn, when that creature would take damage, the amount is reduced by an amount equal to your maneuver modifier.</p>\r\n<h3>Emergency Prescription</h3>\r\n<p>As an action, you can expend one superiority die and touch a creature. That creature regains hit points equal to result of the die + your maneuver modifier, and when that creature makes their first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw before the start of your next turn they roll the superiority die and add it to the roll.</p>\r\n<h3>Enhancement Injection</h3>\r\n<p>As an action, you can expend one superiority die to inject a creature you can touch with enhancements, granting them temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your maneuver modifier, which last for 1 minute. Additionally, when the target makes a Strength or Constitution check or saving throw while it has these temporary hit points, it gains a bonus equal to your maneuver modifier.</p>\r\n<h3>Neuroblock</h3>\r\n<p>When you make an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die and add it to the attack roll. On a hit, the creature's next attack has disadvantage and it cannot regain hit points until the start of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h3>Reassure</h3>\r\n<p>As an action, you can expend a superiority die and call out to a creature within 60 feet that can see or hear you that is charmed, frightened, or stunned. When you do so, that creature immediately makes another saving throw, adding the amount rolled to the save.</p>\r\n<h3>Remove Toxins</h3>\r\n<p>As an action, you can expend a superiority die to purge the toxins from a creature you can touch. The target regains hit points equal to the number rolled and, if it is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.</p>\r\n<h3>Smelling Salts</h3>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can expend a superiority die to heal a creature you can touch by a number of hit points equal to the number rolled.</p>\r\n<h3>Transfusion</h3>\r\n<p>Once per turn when you hit a creature with a finesse melee weapon, you can expend a superiority to give you or an ally that is within 5 feet of the creature a transfusion. Add the superiority dice to the damage you deal. You or your ally gain hit points equivalent to the damage you deal to the creature. </p>\r\n<p>You can be the creature hit with the attack as long as there is an ally with 5 feet of you, in which you can let it hit without rolling an attack and must choose an ally to heal with the transfusion.</p>\r\n<h3>Weak Point Strike</h3>\r\n<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die to temporarily daze the creature. Add the number rolled to the damage of the weapon attack and the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.</p>\r\n<h2>Field Surgeon</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Doctor Pursuit:</strong> 6th and 11th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, you can roll an additional die d6 and add it to the roll. This die increases to d8 at 9th level, d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, if the creature is the target of your Critical Analysis, you can instead choose the maximum on both dice. Once you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 11th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</p>\r\n<h2>Resuscitate</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Doctor Pursuit:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Through your medical studies you have learned to delay seemingly inevitable death. As a bonus action, you can stabilize a creature you can touch that has 0 hit points. </p>\r\n<p>Additionally, as an action, you can tend to a creature you can touch that has died since the end of your last turn. The creature immediately regains 1 hit point and stabilizes. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h2>Panacea</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Doctor Pursuit:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You've developed the formula to concoct a cure-all miracle solution: a panacea. Over the course of 10 minutes, you can expend rare medical supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your panacea in a simple syringe. The panacea retains its potency for 24 hours. As a bonus action, a creature can use the panacea. Alternatively, as an action, they can administer it to another creature within 5 feet.</p>\r\n<p>The target has its exhaustion level reduced by one and regains all of its hit points. If the target is diseased, poisoned, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends.</p>\r\n<p>Once you create a panacea, you can't create another until you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Doctor Discoveries</h2>\r\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect the progress of your studies into the medical arts. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h3>Advanced Remote Healer</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 11th level</em></p>\r\n<p>The range of your Remote Healer feature increases to 60 feet.</p>\r\n<h3>Experimental Treatments</h3>\r\n<p>Your medication and treatments are known to be untested and unstable. Immediately after you use a maneuver that causes a creature to regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, you can choose to roll on the Side Effects table to the right. The condition or effect lasts until the creature completes a long rest, or you use this feature again.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scholar table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>From the Brink</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\r\n<p>If the target of your Critical Analysis feature would be reduced to 0 hp, you may use your reaction and end your Critical Analysis feature to have them be reduced to 1 hp instead. Once a creature has benefited from this feature, they must complete a long rest before they can do so again.</p>\r\n<h3>Health Advisor</h3>\r\n<p>Whenever a creature that is a target of your Critical Analysis feature begins their turn, you can use your reaction to give them temporary hit points equal to one-fourth your scholar level (rounded down) + your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scholar table, which last until the start of their next turn.</p>\r\n<h3>Patient Protector</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can treat creatures within 5 feet of the target of your Critical Analysis feature as if they were also targets of your Critical Analysis.</p>\r\n<h3>Surgical Precision</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em> </p>\r\n<p>When you hit a creature that is the target of your Critical Analysis feature with a weapon attack, it takes additional damage equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p>\r\n<h3>Tend the Wounded</h3>\r\n<p>If you or any friendly creatures you can touch regain hit points by spending one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, each of those creatures regain 1d4 extra hit points.</p>\r\n<p>This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 9th level, 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</p>\r\n<h4>Side Effects</h4>\r\n<p>| d20 | Side Effects  |</p>\r\n<p>|:----:|:-------------|</p>\r\n<p>| 1  | The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1. |</p>\r\n<p>| 2  | The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze. |</p>\r\n<p>| 3 | The creature's legs become swollen. The creature gains 1 slowed level. |</p>\r\n<p>| 4 | The creature becomes one size larger or smaller. |</p>\r\n<p>| 5 | The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC. |</p>\r\n<p>| 6 | The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 17th level. | </p>\r\n<p>| 7 | The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.|</p>\r\n<p>| 8 | The creature's eyes glows bright red. The creature also gains darkvision, but if they already have darkvision they get a light headache instead. |</p>\r\n<p>| 9 | The creature gains advantage on perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage. |</p>\r\n<p>| 10 | The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.|</p>\r\n<p>| 11  | The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.  |</p>\r\n<p>| 12  |  The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage. |</p>\r\n<p>| 13 | The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft. |</p>\r\n<p>| 14 | The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare. |</p>\r\n<p>| 15 | The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.|</p>\r\n<p>| 16 | The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion. |</p>\r\n<p>| 17 | The creature believes they are the chosen one. |</p>\r\n<p>| 18 | The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved. |</p>\r\n<p>| 19 | The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage. |</p>\r\n<p>| 20 | The creature gains 10d10 hit points, and they feel happy and carefree. |</p>"

Founded on a mastery of sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include many different weapons.</p>\r\n<h2>Echani Weapons</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Echani Order:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. You gain the following benefits. Choose two types of weapons to be your Echani weapons: one vibroweapon and one blaster. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the special property. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this order's features work only with your Echani weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon to be an Echani weapon for you, following the criteria above.</p>\r\n<h3>Agile Parry</h3>\r\n<p>If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding an Echani weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated.</p>\r\n<h3>Echani's Shot</h3>\r\n<p>You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with an Echani weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using an Echani weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.</p>\r\n<h2>One with the Blade</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Echani Order:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You extend your focus into your Echani weapons, granting you the following benefits.</p>\r\n<h3>Enhanced Echani Weapons</h3>\r\n<p>Your attacks with your Echani weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.</p>\r\n<h3>Deft Strike</h3>\r\n<p>When you hit a target with an Echani weapon, you can spend 1 focus point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die.

As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 focus points to grant one Echani weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on an enhanced weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p>\r\n<h2>Unerring Accuracy</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Echani Order:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you miss with an attack roll using a monk weapon on your turn, you can reroll it. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns. </p>"

Additionally, when you engage in crafting with gadgeteer's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.</p>\r\n<h2>Gadgeteer Harness</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gadgeteer Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn to create and modify adventuring gear utilizing your gadgeteer experience. Over the course of a long rest, you can create your modified gadgeteer harness. You must have gadgeteer's implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\r\n<p>Your gadgeteer harness is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your gadgeteer harness has 4 modification slots to which you can affix gadgets, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\r\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws.

The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + your engineer level. Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, or sonic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature take any remaining damage. </p>\r\n<h3>Physical Barrier</h3>\r\n<p>You project a physical barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + half your engineer level (rounded down).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Reinforced Barriers</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gadgeteer Engineering:</strong> 14th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When you cast a tech power while you have a barrier active, you can restore hit points to the barrier, provided it is within 30 feet of you. You restore a number of hit points equal to twice the power's level, or 1 hit point for an at-will power. This can't increase a barrier's hit points above its initial hit points. If you have multiple barriers active, you can divide these hit points between them as you see fit.</p>\r\n<h2>Adaptive Barrier</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gadgeteer Engineering:</strong> 18th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When a creature who has one of your barriers within 30 feet of you that you can see takes damage, and that damage is of a type that could be affected by that barrier, you can use your reaction to grant them resistance to the triggering damage. If that damage is the same type as the barrier's chosen damage, you instead grant them immunity. Whether resistance or immunity, the barrier immediately drops to 0 hit points.</p>\r\n<h2>Gadgeteer Contraptions</h2>\r\n<p>If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.</p>\r\n<h3>Advanced Grounding System</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level, Prototype Grounding System</em></p>\r\n<p>While wearing your gadgeteer harness you have immunity to lightning damage.</p>\r\n<h3>Auto-Injection Regenerator</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You install a special kolto injector into your gadgeteer harness that can inject you with kolto in response to pain.

While wearing these goggles, you have darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this modification increases its range by 30 feet.</p>\r\n<h3>Extended Tank</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level, Jet Pack</em></p>\r\n<p>Your jet pack now lasts up to 10 minutes when activated.</p>\r\n<h3>Flame Vents</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level, Jet Pack</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn the <em>flame sweep</em> tech power and can cast it at first level without using tech points. Once you have used this ability, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, while your jet pack is active, you can cast <em>flame sweep</em> using your bonus action instead of your action.</p>\r\n<h3>Grounding System</h3>\r\n<p>While wearing your gadgeteer harness you are immune to the shocked condition.</p>\r\n<h3>Integrated Inhibitor</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\r\n<p>While using your harness as a tech focus, you gain a +1 bonus to your tech save DC.

Activating or deactivating the jets requires a bonus action and, while active, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. </p>\r\n<p>The jet pack last for 1 minute before deactivating. Once the jets have been activated, they can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p>Your jet pack's speed increases to 40 feet at 5th level, 50 feet at 9th level, 60 feet at 13th level, 70 feet at 17th level, and 80 feet at 20th level.</p>\r\n<h3>Mechanical Arm</h3>\r\n<p>You create a mechanical arm which mounts to your shoulder, which you can use independently. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time.</p>\r\n<p>You can choose this modification twice.</p>\r\n<h3>Mimicker</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You create a device that attaches to your gadgeteer harness. Your mimicker casts a shadow that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function for 1 minute. Your mimicker is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.</p>\r\n<h3>Miniaturized Hydraulics</h3>\r\n<p>Your gadgeteer harness can store 20 pounds of equipment without adding to your encumbrance.</p>\r\n<h3>Oil Spill</h3>\r\n<p>As an action, you can cast the <em>oil slick</em> tech power without expending tech points. When you cast the power in this way, the oil will remain in place for the full duration of the power.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h3>Powered Grappling Hook</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level, Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</em></p>\r\n<p>While your wrist-mounted grappling hook is deployed, when you cast a tech power with a range of touch, your hook can deliver the power as if it had cast it.</p>\r\n<h3>Prototype Grounding System</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level, Grounding System</em></p>\r\n<p>While wearing your gadgeteer harness you have resistance to lightning damage.</p>\r\n<h3>Quick Start Engine</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level, Jet Pack</em></p>\r\n<p>You can now activate your Jet Pack as an object interaction rather than as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<h3>Recycled Adrenals</h3>\r\n<p>You can augment a single adrenal to regain its charge. This adrenal can only be used by you, and it can only affect you. Once you've used this adrenal, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Recycled Explosives</h3>\r\n<p>You can augment a single explosive to regain its charge. This explosive can only be used by you, and it uses your tech save DC instead of its own, unless its own DC would be higher. Once you've used this explosive, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Recycled Stimpacs</h3>\r\n<p>You can augment a single stimpac to regain its charge. This stimpac can only be used by you, and it can only affect you. Once you've used this stimpac, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Sentry Turret</h3>\r\n<p>You learn how to craft small sentry turrets shaped like globes that can adhere to any surface. As an action or bonus action (your choice), you can throw a sentry to a point you can see within range (30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5). At the end of each of your turns, a deployed sentry automatically targets a hostile creature within 10 feet of it. If multiple targets are available, one is chosen at random. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d4 energy damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn. If a creature would be targeted by more than one of these sentries, it only makes this saving throw once, taking an additional d4 damage for each sentry beyond the first.</p>\r\n<p>The sentries have 1 hit point, an armor class of 10, and can be repaired over the course of a long rest. Each sentry lasts for 1 minute before deactivating. You can maintain a number of sentries equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once a sentry has been activated, it can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Shocking Hook</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level, Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</em></p>\r\n<p>After hitting a creature with your grappling hook, you can use the connection to deliver an at-will tech power. As a bonus action, you can cast an at-will tech power at the target with a range of touch. If the power requires an attack roll, you have advantage. If the target requires a saving throw, the target has disadvantage. </p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover the hook.</p>\r\n<h3>Stealth Field Generator</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You create an augmented belt that functions as a portable, personal cloaking device. Activating or deactivating the generator requires a bonus action and, while active, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks that rely on sight. The generator lasts for 1 minute. This effect ends early if you make an attack or cast a force- or tech- power.</p>\r\n<p>Once the belt has been activated, it can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Shocking Barrier</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You enhanced your barriers. Whenever a creature with one of your barriers active takes damage from a creature within 5 feet of it, the damaged creature can roll your Potent Aptitude die, dealing the result of the die as lightning damage to the creature that damaged it.</p>\r\n<h3>Truesight Goggles</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 11th level, Darkvision Goggles</em></p>\r\n<p>You modify your goggles with a toggle allowing you to briefly gain enhanced sight. As a bonus action, you can activate the truesight feature of your goggles. When toggled on, for the next minute your goggles now automatically dispel illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h3>Weapon Integration</h3>\r\n<p>You can integrate a single weapon that weighs no more than 8 lb. into your gadgeteer harness. While integrated, that weapon gains the hidden and fixed properties. </p>\r\n<h3>Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</h3>\r\n<p>You craft a wrist-mounted grappling hook weapon attached to a tightly coiled cord. With this contraption, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.</p>\r\n<p>A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.</p>\r\n<p>While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.</p>"

                "value": "<h1>Gambler Pursuit</h1>\r\n<p>Not all studied men and women use their intelligence and skill for the pursuit of knowledge, but instead turn to the various casinos and betting halls of the galaxy. Those scholars who choose the Gambler Pursuit use their knowledge of probability and risk to attempt to master games of chance and build their fortune, or lose it all along the way.</p>\r\n<h2>Gambler's Aptitude</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gambler Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain proficiency with your choice of gaming set and your choice of the Insight, Deception, Persuasion, or Sleight of Hand skills. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.</p>\r\n<h2>Risk versus Reward</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gambler Pursuit:</strong> 3rd, 9th, 13th, and 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When you make your first attack on your turn against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you can decide to gamble by rolling a d6. On a roll of 4 or higher, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the start of your next turn. On a roll of 3 or lower, that creature instead has advantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p>This die increases to d8 at 9th level, d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level.</p>\r\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gambler Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain access to new maneuvers which reflect your deep understanding of chance. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h3>All In</h3>\r\n<p>When you make an attack roll, and the result is less than 20, you can expend a superiority die and roll it, adding it to the roll. If the resulting sum is 20 or 23, the attack is considered a critical hit.</p>\r\n<h3>Blind Luck</h3>\r\n<p>When you fail an ability check, you can expend a superiority die. If the result of your ability check plus the superiority die is within a range equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) above or below the check's DC, you pass the check instead. </p>\r\n<h3>Double Bluff</h3>\r\n<p>If on the same round of combat that you have missed a weapon attack, an enemy also misses you with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and make a single weapon attack, adding the results of your superiority die to both the attack and damage rolls.</p>\r\n<h3>The Idiot's Array</h3>\r\n<p>When a creature hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you take minimum damage on the damage roll and subtract the value of the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead take the maximum.</p>\r\n<h3>Played Their Hand</h3>\r\n<p>When a creature hits you with an opportunity attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses, you can make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the attacker's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (their choice) as a part of this reaction. On a success, the target drops the weapon it made the attack with. If you are within 5 feet of the target, and you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, the object lands at its feet.</p>\r\n<h3>Pure Sabacc </h3>\r\n<p>When you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and roll it. On a roll of 4 or higher, you deal maximum damage on the weapon's damage roll, including the superiority die. On a roll of 3 or lower, you instead deal the minimum.</p>\r\n<h3>Raise the Stakes</h3>\r\n<p>When the target of your Critical Analysis feature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die. Roll the die and subtract the result from the enemy's attack roll, but add the result to their damage roll on a hit.</p>\r\n<h3>Take a Chance</h3>\r\n<p>Before making an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die. On a miss, you lose that superiority die and do not benefit from it in any way. On a hit, you can choose two other maneuvers that you know, and subject the target to both maneuvers, without expending additional superiority dice.</p>\r\n<h3>Tiebreaker</h3>\r\n<p>When you roll a superiority die as a part of a maneuver you learned from this class, you can expend another superiority die and use the total of both dice.</p>\r\n<h2>Lucky Number 7</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gambler Pursuit:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Whenever you roll a 7 on an attack roll against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, the attack automatically hits and you regain a superiority die. You can not have more superiority dice than the amount shown in the Superiority Dice column of the scholar table.</p>\r\n<p>When attacking with advantage or disadvantage, this effect applies if either roll is a 7. If both rolls are a 7, the attack is a critical hit.</p>\r\n<h2>Tell Me the Odds</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gambler Pursuit:</strong> 9th, 13th, and 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>If the target of your Critical Analysis hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d8. On a 4 or higher, you impose disadvantage on the roll. If the target already had disadvantage, they must instead reroll one of the dice once (your choice).</p>\r\n<p>This die increases to d10 at 13th level and d12 at 17th level.</p>\r\n<h2>Borrowed Luck</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gambler Pursuit:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You have gained the ability to unnaturally alter luck in your favor. Once per round, after an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check is rolled by you or a creature that you can see, you can replace the number on the d20 with a 7. Note the number on the d20 of the roll that you replaced. That number becomes your borrowed luck roll.</p>\r\n<p>While you have a borrowed luck roll, you can expend it and replace any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made by you or a creature that you can see with the value of the borrowed luck roll. You can only have one borrowed luck roll at a time, and you lose any unused borrowed luck rolls when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Gambler Discoveries</h2>\r\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your deep understanding of chance. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order. </p>\r\n<h3>Ace Up Your Sleeve</h3>\r\n<p>Whenever you make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can expend a superiority die, adding the result to your total for the check.</p>\r\n<h3>Against the House</h3>\r\n<p>Whenever you would make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling, you can instead challenge the target to a game of chance. If they accept your offer, you can make an ability check with an available gaming set. If you win the challenge, you automatically succeed on the Charisma (Persuasion) check.</p>\r\n<h3>Ante Up</h3>\r\n<p>When you roll initiative, are not surprised, and end up first in the initiative order, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action during your first turn in combat.</p>\r\n<h3>Calculated Bluff</h3>\r\n<p>When you make an ability check using your Charisma, you can choose to instead make the check using your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice).</p>\r\n<h3>Cold Read</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you may make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by a target's Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, you know the next action the target intends to take, so long as the situation does not change dramatically.</p>\r\n<h3>Feeling the Pressure</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Whenever you roll a 4 or higher on your Risk Versus Reward feature, the target of your Critical Analysis feature also has disadvantage on attack rolls made against you until the start of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h3>The Magic Number</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Whenever you roll a 7 on an ability check or saving throw, you can reroll the ability check or saving throw with advantage.</p>"

Once per round, when you are the target of a ranged attack, or you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw, and there is cover within 10 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet (no action required). You must end this movement in cover.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Trick Shooter</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gunslinger Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn a number of trick shots you can use to debilitate enemies and impress allies. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a trick shot. </p>\r\n<p>Some of your trick shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: </p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<p><strong>Trick Shot save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<h3>Blinding Shot</h3>\r\n<p>You attempt to blind the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. </p>\r\n<h3>Brutal Shot</h3>\r\n<p>You attempt to knock the target prone. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  </p>\r\n<h3>Hampering Shot</h3>\r\n<p>You attempt to hobble the enemy's movement. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, it gains 1 slowed level and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the end of its next turn.</p>\r\n<h2>Spinning Flourish</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gunslinger Practice:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can flourish your weapon in an intimidating or charming manner. As an action, you can cause one creature within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, the target is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn. </p>\r\n<h2>Ricochet Shot</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gunslinger Practice:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn how to work all the angles. Once per turn, when you take the Attack action and miss with a ranged weapon attack, you can repeat the attack against a different target within 10 feet of the original target (no action required).</p>\r\n<h2>Quickdraw</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Gunslinger Practice:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn to perform miracles with just a blaster and some nerve. On your first turn in combat, if you aren't surprised, you can use your action to attack creatures that have not yet acted. Choose up to six such creatures that you can see, making a ranged weapon attack against each. On a hit, you deal normal weapon damage and can apply a single trick shot to each attack made this way. </p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>"

                "value": "<h1>Marauder Approach</h1>\r\n<p>Few things are more terrifying than being in the path of a Berserker who has learned the ways of the Force. Those who follow this path unlock something deep within them, a well of untamed power from the depths of their fury. When a marauder unleashes their rage, they channel their brute strength into primal might, and uses it to devastate his foes in a hail of fire, blades, and blood. Due to the uncontrolled nature of their powers, marauders have a dangerous predilection for the strength and raw power offered by the dark side, and many fall into it's clutches. Even those who do not are always temped by the voices of fury barely contained within.</p>\r\n<h2>Forcecasting</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Marauder Approach:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You have derived powers from your primal connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.</p>\r\n<h3>Force Powers Known</h3>\r\n<p>You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.</p>\r\n<h3>Force Points</h3>\r\n<p>You have a number of force points equal to your berserker level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\r\n<p>Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table.</p>\r\n<p>You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Forcecasting Ability</h3>\r\n<p>Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability score modifier whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<p><strong>Force save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<p><strong>Force attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<h2>Furious Force</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Marauder Approach:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can cast force powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action, the power does not require concentration, and you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from force powers you cast that require a force attack or saving throw. If a force power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of them. </p>\r\n<p>Casting force powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a force power that requires a force attack.</p>\r\n<h2>Reckless Power</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Marauder Approach:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Weapons and the force are equally an extension of your rage. While you are raging and you use your action to cast a force power, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<h4>Marauder Approach Forcecasting</h4>\r\n<h2>Powerful Presence</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Marauder Approach:</strong> 10th level</em></p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with force energy. Choose up to ten other creatures of within 60 feet of you that can hear you. Friendly creatures have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn, and hostile creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Force Storm</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Marauder Approach:</strong> 14th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can expel the might of your rage all at once to unleash a devastating storm of force energy. As an action, you can end your rage early, forcing each creature within 15 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d12 force damage for each round you've spent in rage, or half as much on a successful one. </p>"

Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.</p>\r\n<p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you, and it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for up to 24 hours. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the effect ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.</p>\r\n<p>You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that an officer givers her gun to the first smuggler she meets.

While in this stance, the first time you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength each turn, you can attempt to damage another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>\r\n<p>This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die.

If you do so, energy and kinetic damage you take from weapons before the end of your next turn is reduced by an amount equal to your Strength modifier. You can not use this feature if you have moved more than half your speed this turn.</p>\r\n<h3>Falling Avalanche</h3>\r\n<p>On your turn, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force (no action required) and reduce your speed by half to gain advantage on the next ability check or attack roll you make using Strength before the end of your next turn.

Choose Precise Reflection for Shien or Brutal Strikes for Djem So.</p>\r\n<h3>Precise Reflection</h3>\r\n<p>When you hit with an attack made by the <em>saber reflect</em> power, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.</p>\r\n<h3>Brutal Strikes</h3>\r\n<p>The Force flowing through you grants you incredible strength. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Force-Empowered Strikes or Improved Force-Empowered Strikes damage die, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when you spend force points to use your Force-Empowered Strikes feature, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice the number of points spent.</p>\r\n<h2>Master of Perseverance</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Shien/Djem So Form:</strong> 20th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your might overwhelms even the most implacable of foes. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 2. Your maximum for these scores increases by 2.

Additionally, when you engage in crafting with tinker's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.</p>\r\n<h2>Modified Tinkercannon</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Unstable Engineering:</strong> 3rd, 9th, and 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn to enhance your tinker's implements with unstable science, modifying them into a harness with a cannon. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your tinker's implements to create a tinkercannon. You must have tinker's implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\r\n<p>Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher while wielding your tinkercannon, you risk unexpected complications. Your GM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table to create a random effect. </p>\r\n<p>Additionally, your tinkercannon come equipped with four overrides, and they gain more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you trigger an Unstable Engineering Surge, you can use an override to reroll the percentile dice. You must use the new result, you can only do this once per surge, and each time you do so in excess of your proficiency bonus (resetting on a long rest) your maximum tech points is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended overrides when you complete a long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Unstable Volley</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Unstable Engineering:</strong> 3rd, 9th, and 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>While wielding your tinkercannon, as a bonus action you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to launch a volley of unstable energy at a surface located within 30 feet of you that you can see. This energy adheres to the surface for 1 minute, after which it erupts. As a part of this bonus action, or as a bonus action on a following turn, you can cause the energy to erupt early. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. </p>\r\n<p>The range at which you can launch your volley increases to 60 feet at 9th level, and 120 feet at 17th level.</p>\r\n<p>This damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.</p>\r\n<h2>Creative Destruction</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Unstable Engineering:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can add your governing ability modifier (minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with tech powers and class features that don't already include that modifier. If the tech power or class feature would damage multiple creatures, you can only deal this additional damage to one of them.</p>\r\n<p>If you choose to deal this additional damage, your GM can have you roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table.</p>\r\n<h2>Experimental Overrides </h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Unstable Engineering:</strong> 14th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain a modicum of control over your surges. Whenever you roll on the Unstable Engineering Surge table and use one of your overrides, you can choose either total.</p>\r\n<h2>Engineering Bombardment</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Unstable Engineering:</strong> 18th level</em></p>\r\n<p>The harmful energies of your tech powers and class features intensify. When you roll damage for a tech power or class feature and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, you can roll it again and use both results. You can only use this ability once per tech power or class feature.</p>\r\n<h4>Unstable Engineering Surge</h4>\r\n<p>|d100|Result|</p>\r\n<p>|:--|:--|</p>\r\n<p>|01-02|Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for 1 minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.\t|</p>\r\n<p>|03-04|For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it.\t|</p>\r\n<p>|05-06|A DRK-1 tracker droid appears with 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later.|</p>\r\n<p>|07-08|You cast <em>explosion</em> at 3rd-level centered on yourself without expending tech points.|</p>\r\n<p>|09-10|You cast <em>homing rockets</em> at 5th-level without expending tech points.|</p>\r\n<p>|11-12|Roll a d10.

The Warchief Approach is one forged from alliances, bonds, and strategy. In combat, your rages are less mindless, and more focused. Ignoring the distractions of unimportant events, your attention hones in on the battlefield and how best to direct and control it. You guide your allies' strikes, and your presence is enough to wash away their fatigue.</p>\r\n<h2>Savage Diplomat</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Warchief Approach:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your path necessitates that you build relationships with others, for the betterment of your tribe or yourself. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Persuasion or Intimidation. You can choose to learn one language in place of the skill proficiency.</p>\r\n<h2>Commanding Rage</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Warchief Approach:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You become more aware of your allies, and their intent when fighting at your side. While you are raging, when an ally within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an enemy, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack and add your rage damage bonus to the damage roll, if the attack hits.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Inspiring Presence</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Warchief Approach:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your mere presence on the battlefield rallies your allies. When you rage, choose up to 3 allies that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature gains temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level (rounded down) + your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).</p>\r\n<h2>Raid Planning</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Warchief Approach:</strong> 10th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn to flare up your allies' drive for combat, urging them to follow you into the fray. During a long rest, you tell sagas, sing battle songs, and give inspiring speeches. At the end of the long rest choose up to 5 creatures that can hear and understand you (which can include yourself) to add your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) to their next initiative roll, and a 10 foot bonus to their speed on their first turn of combat.</p>\r\n<h2>War Chant</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Warchief Approach:</strong> 14th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You have memorized the litanies, songs, and chants of your people and their dedication to war. When you enter a rage on your turn, you can enter a commanding rage for one minute. When you do so, during this turn and at the start of each of your turns, you have a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus you can only use for your Commanding Rage feature. When you use Commanding Rage with these special reactions, they do not count against your uses of that feature. You can only use one reaction per turn. Additionally, during this rage, when an enemy within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an ally, you can use your reaction to reduce the attack by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>"

On a hit, the target takes additional force damage equal to the number rolled. </p>\r\n<h3>You Call This Archaeology?</h3>\r\n<p>When you or a friendly creature that you can see reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die to give yourself or that friendly creature temporary hit points equal to the number rolled + your universal forcecasting modifier.</p>\r\n<h2>Force Carving</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Archaeologist Pursuit:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You have unlocked more control over the Force, allowing you to choose wisely who it affects. When you cast a force power that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number </p>\r\n<p>of them equal to 1 + the power's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the power, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p>\r\n<h2>Psychometric Analysis</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Archaeologist Pursuit:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your strength in the Force and your ability to read the objects around you intensifies. You can use your Critical Analysis to analyze an object of Huge size or smaller that you can see within range. When you do so, you learn whether or not the object is enhanced, cursed, and how old it is. </p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you can end your Critical Analysis on the object (no action required) to ask it a single question and receive an answer, usually in the form of an auditory or visual hallucination. For example, touching the rusted, broken remains of a lightsaber and asking how it got there may result in a brief vision of a disgruntled Jedi Knight casting it to the ground on that spot. An object \u2014questioned\u2014 in this way can only provide information relating to its past. The GM has the final say on what objects can be questioned, and to what extent.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature four times. You gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Knowledge is Power</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Archaeologist Pursuit:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain the ability to steal the knowledge of how to cast a power from another forcecaster. When a hostile creature casts a force power that affects a friendly creature within range of your Critical Analysis feature, and you use your reaction target that friendly creature with your Critical Analysis feature, you can force the creature casting the power to make a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw (your choice) against your universal force save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.</p>\r\n<p>On a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and you steal the knowledge of that power if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast. For the next 8 hours, you know the power and can cast it using your force points. The creature cannot cast that power again until the 8 hours have passed.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Archaeologist Discoveries</h2>\r\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your studies into historical civilations. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order. </p>\r\n<h3>Archive Research</h3>\r\n<p>Your expeditions have turned up a bevy of knowledge on the force. You learn three at-will force powers of your choice, which don't count against your number of force powers known.</p>\r\n<h3>Force Combat Knowledge</h3>\r\n<p>Your research into Jedi and Sith combat techniques has allowed you to gain proficiency in simple lightweapons. Additionally, you gain knowledge of one lightsaber form of your choice.</p>\r\n<h3>It Belongs in a Museum</h3>\r\n<p>Your knowledge of antiquities is unparalleled. When you make an Intelligence (Lore) check or an ability check with your archaeologist kit, you may treat any roll of a 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\r\n<h3>Localized Survey</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your affinity for the force allows you to key in to the recent past of an area you enter. When you would expend a use of your Psychometric Analysis, you can instead choose to target your immediate vicinity (up to a 50-foot cube) and investigate for at least 1 minute. For each minute you investigate, you see visions of recent events in the area going back a number of days equal to your scholar level, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. </p>\r\n<p>You can investigate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your scholar level and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were concentrating on a power. </p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Making This Up As You Go</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You may now cast force powers at 4th-level twice between rests. </p>\r\n<h3>Telekinetic Ministrations</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can cast the <em>telekinesis</em> force power at 5th level without spending force points.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h3>The Years and the Mileage</h3>\r\n<p>Your archaeological studies have taken you all across the galaxy. While you are the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you can use your universal forcecasting ability instead of Wisdom when making Insight or Survival checks.</p>\r\n<h3>Tomb of the Ancients</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\r\n<p>As a reaction when you take damage, you can entomb yourself in the Force until the end of your next turn. For the duration, you have resistance to the triggering damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your universal forcecasting ability modifier + your scholar level to potentially absorb the attack, and your speed is reduced to 0.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. </p>"

Additionally, when you engage in crafting with artificer's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.</p>\r\n<h2>Modified Lightsaber</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Artificer Engineering:</strong> 3rd and 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn to modify an unenhanced lightsaber utilizing your artificer knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your lightsaber. You must have the lightsaber and artificer's implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\r\n<p>Your modified lightsaber is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified lightsaber has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\r\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\r\n<p>At 9th level, you can maintain two different modified lightsabers. The total modification slots are split across the two items.</p>\r\n<h2>Force Resonance</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Artificer Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>Once per round, when you hit a creature with your modified lightsaber, you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to deal an extra 2d6 damage to that target. The damage is the same type as your modified lightsaber's damage.</p>\r\n<p>The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 11th level, and 8d6 at 17th level.</p>\r\n<h2>Forcecasting Secrets</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Artificer Engineering:</strong> 6th, 7th, 13th, and 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your study of kyber crystals has awakened a latent force sensitivity. Choose two force powers of 1st level. The chosen powers count as tech powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the engineer table.</p>\r\n<p>At 7th level, you learn two additional force powers of 1st or 2nd level. At 13th level, you learn two force powers of 1st-3rd level, and at 17th level, you learn two force powers of 1st-4th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the force powers you know and replace it with another force power of the same level.</p>\r\n<h2>Disruptive Resonance</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Artificer Engineering:</strong> 14th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When you hit a creature that is concentrating on a power with your modified lightsaber, the creature has disadvantage on the Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature immediately takes psychic damage equal to your engineer level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\r\n<h2>Resonating Recovery</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Artificer Engineering:</strong> 18th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Once per turn, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain a use of your Potent Aptitude. Your number of Potent Aptitude uses can not exceed your Intelligence modifier.</p>\r\n<h2>Artificer Modifications</h2>\r\n<p>If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.</p>\r\n<h3>Additonal Beam Port</h3>\r\n<p>You install a second beam port into your modified lightsaber. Your modified lightsaber gains the double (1d8) property. You can only benefit from this property while wielding your modified lightsaber with two hands.</p>\r\n<h3>Adegan Crystal</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls made with this weapon. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.</p>\r\n<h3>Advanced Blastsaber </h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 15th level, Prototype Blastsaber</em></p>\r\n<p>You further fine tune your blastsaber. As an action, you can disable a single electronic device not being worn or held by another creature within 5 feet of you. The device is then disabled until it is rebooted.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon, you create a projected barrier of ion energy in a 10-foot-radius sphere around you until the start of your next turn. Hostile creatures treat this area as difficult terrain. When a hostile creature enters the shielded area or starts its turn there, that creature takes 3d4 ion damage. Any electronics not being worn or held within the barrier's radius are disabled until rebooted.</p>\r\n<h3>Advanced Brightsaber </h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 15th level, Prototype Brightsaber</em></p>\r\n<p>You further fine tune your brightsaber. While activated, your modified lightsaber's bright light now automatically dispels illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon and use a bonus action to attempt to blind your target, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage.</p>\r\n<h3>Advanced Disruptorsaber</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 15th level, Prototype Disruptorsaber</em></p>\r\n<p>You further fine tune your disruptorsaber. While activated, your modified lightsaber lightly obscures the area within 5 feet of it.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when you activate this conversion to alter the properties of your lightweapon and use a bonus action to attempt to knock your target prone, the next saving throw you make before the end of your next turn has advantage.</p>\r\n<h3>Barrier </h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\r\n<p>On your turn, when you make an attack roll with your modified lightsaber, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If you do, you can use your reaction to erect a temporary barrier that lasts until the start of your next turn. While the barrier is activated, you have a bonus to AC against the first attack roll made against you equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>\r\n<h3>Beam Gem Lens</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this weapon. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 13th level.</p>\r\n<h3>Biometric Safety Measures</h3>\r\n<p>A security system is installed into the hilt of your lightweapon. When a creature other than you attempts to activate your lightweapon, the activation fails. Additionally, the creature attempting to activate must make on a Constitution saving throw or take lightning damage equal to engineer level, and become shocked until the start of its next turn. On a successful save the creature takes half damage and is not shocked. Regardless of success or failure, the creature drops your modified lightsaber.</p>\r\n<h3>Blastsaber Conversion</h3>\r\n<p><em>Incompatible with other conversions</em></p>\r\n<p>You heavily modify your lightweapon to allow you to make a ranged weapon attack. With this modification, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d6 energy damage.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when you make your first attack on your turn, you can alter the properties of your modified lightsaber. Until the start of your next turn, the damage type of your modified lightsaber is changed to ion. </p>\r\n<p>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Brightsaber Conversion</h3>\r\n<p><em>Incompatible with other conversions</em></p>\r\n<p>You modify your lightweapon, giving it a brighter glow. While activated, your modified lightsaber sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when you make your first attack on your turn, you can alter the properties of your modified lightsaber. Until the start of your next turn, the damage type of your modified lightsaber is changed to fire.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Burn Through</h3>\r\n<p>When you score a critical hit with your modified lightsaber, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make against that creature.</p>\r\n<h3>Comfortable Handle</h3>\r\n<p>You make minor modifications to the ergonomics of your modified saber's hilt. Your modified lightsaber gains the finesse property.</p>\r\n<h3>Crossguard</h3>\r\n<p>You add an energy guard at the base of your modified lightsaber's blade. While wielding your modified lightsaber, you gain a +1 bonus to your armor class against melee weapon attacks.</p>\r\n<h3>Disruptorsaber Conversion</h3>\r\n<p><em>Incompatible with other conversions</em></p>\r\n<p>You modify your lightweapon, causing it to eminate a sickly green light. Your modified lightsaber loses the luminous property.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when you make your first attack on your turn, you can alter the properties of your modified lightsaber. Until the start of your next turn, the damage type of your modified lightsaber is changed to acid.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once).

Followers of the Artillerist Technique learn to exert greater control of their tech powers, causing delayed\u2014and often empowered\u2014effects.</p>\r\n<h2>Modular Munitions</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Artillerist Technique:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>When you cast a tech power, rather than having it take effect instantly, you can choose to delay the effect to occur on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). When you do so, any creature that leaves the affected area of your tech power is unaffected when the tech power occurs. If the power would only target one creature, and that creature moves from the space it was in when you cast the power, the tech power automatically misses if it would call for an attack roll, as if you had rolled a 1 on the attack, and the creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw against the power if it calls for a saving throw, as if it had rolled a 20 on the save.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when you cast a tech power and choose to delay it in this way, and that tech power would deal damage, you can apply one of the following additional empowerment effects:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flashbang</strong>: Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded and deafened until the start of your next turn.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Mire:</strong> Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain one slowed level until the start of your next turn.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Psyche:</strong> Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the start of your next turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>If an empowerment effect calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\r\n<p>You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<p>While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 tech point to use it. When you do so, your maximum tech points are reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Mark of the Artillerist</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Artillerist Technique:</strong> 3rd and 11th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can now use your Ranger's Quarry feature on a 10-foot cube area within 60 feet of you that you can see. You can treat any creatures inside this cube as if they are the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature, and when a creature is hit by a tech attack or fails a saving throw against a tech power you cast that deals damage, you can apply your Ranger's Quarry damage to that creature.</p>\r\n<p>At 11th level, you can now use your Ranger's Quarry feature on a 15-foot cube area, instead of a 10-foot cube.</p>\r\n<h2>Sundered Defenses</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Artillerist Technique:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your precise bombardments make even the most hardened defenses crumble. When you cast a power that calls for a tech attack or a Dexterity saving throw, it reduces partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter) against creatures affected by it. If an affected creature has one-quarter cover, your power ignores it entirely.</p>\r\n<h2>Target Masking</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Artillerist Technique:</strong> 11th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You are familiar with various turrets and defensive emplacements, and their operation. </p>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can activate a masking effect to confuse the targeting of constructs for 1 minute. Any construct who targets you with an attack, a harmful power, or a hostile action must first make a Wisdom saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, the construct must choose a new target or lose the attack or power. This power doesn't protect you from area effects.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Master of Ordnance</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Artillerist Technique:</strong> 15th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can now expend two uses of your Modular Munitions feature when you cast a tech power to apply two empowerment effects, instead of only one. Additionally, you gain three additional empowerment effects:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Confusion:</strong> Each creature damaged by this power must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, on its next turn, a creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Knockout:</strong> Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Static:</strong> Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or become shocked until the start of your next turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, when you would spend 1 tech point to apply an empowerment effect, it no longer reduces your maximum tech points.</p>"

                "value": "<h1>Audiotech Engineering</h1>\r\n<p>Those engineers who choose the Audiotech Engineering focus on using a specially modified instrument to use music to assist their allies and disrupt their enemies.</p>\r\n<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Audiotech Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain proficiency in three musical instruments and audiotech's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with audiotech\u2014s implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.</p>\r\n<h2>Modified Instrument</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Audiotech Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn to modify an instrument utilizing your audiotech knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify an instrument. You must have the instrument and audiotech's implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\r\n<p>Your modified instrument is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified instrument has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\r\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\r\n<h2>Potent Amplitude</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Audiotech Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action while wielding your modified instrument, you can begin performing an enhanced song, which lasts for 1 minute. While playing a song, you gain access to a new use for your Potent Aptitude, as determined by the song, listed below. You can end your song at any time, no action required.</p>\r\n<p>Whenever you take damage while playing your song, you must make a Constitution saving throw to continue playing. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, which number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, you must make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</p>\r\n<p>When you cast a damage dealing tech power while playing your song that requires an attack roll or saving throw, you can cause that power to instead deal sonic damage. If you do so, instead of an attack roll or saving throw, the power instead requires a Constitution saving throw.</p>\r\n<p>Your song ends early if you are incapacitated or die, or if you are no longer holding your modified instrument.</p>\r\n<p>You can initiate playing an enhanced song twice. You regain all expended songs when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Song of Battle</h3>\r\n<p>When an ally within 60 feet of you that can hear you deals damage to a creature, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude, adding the result of the die to the damage dealt.</p>\r\n<h3>Song of Support</h3>\r\n<p>When an ally within 60 feet of you that can hear you makes a saving throw against a harmful effect, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude, adding the result of the die to their saving throw.</p>\r\n<h3>Song of Disruption</h3>\r\n<p>When an enemy within 60 feet of you that can hear you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude, subtracting the result of the die from their saving throw.</p>\r\n<h2>Concussive Blast</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Audiotech Engineering:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You add your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with tech powers and class features that deal sonic damage.</p>\r\n<h2>Smooth Rhythm</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Audiotech Engineering:</strong> 14th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Whenever you use your Potent Aptitude while your playing an enhanced song, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Potent Aptitude Dice.</p>\r\n<h2>Legendary Coda</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Audiotech Engineering:</strong> 18th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You've gained mastery over your modified instrument. As an action, you can end your enhanced song in a triumphant blast of power with an effect determined by the song you are playing.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h3>Battle Crescendo</h3>\r\n<p>Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Each must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 14d6 sonic damage and is stunned for 1d4+1 turns. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't stunned. If a creature is killed by this power, its head explodes.</p>\r\n<h3>Support Crescendo</h3>\r\n<p>Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Once in the next minute, each creature can, as a free action in response to taking damage, choose to halve that damage.

Additionally, when you engage in crafting with biotech's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.</p>\r\n<h2>Modified Self</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Biotech Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You've learned to make modifications to your body, cybernetically augmenting yourself. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify yourself with cybernetic augmentations. You must have biotech's implements in order to perform this modification.</p>\r\n<p>While you have at least one cybernetic augmentation installed, your body counts as a tech focus for your tech powers. Additionally, you have 4 modification slots, and you gain more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>\r\n<p>Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.</p>\r\n<h2>Quick-Release Stimulant</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Biotech Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>When you are dealt damage by an attack while you have at least one cybernetic augmentation installed, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to reduce the damage you take. The damage is reduced by an amount equal to 1d10 + your Constitution modifier + your engineer level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can gain temporary hit points equal to the remaining damage reduction.</p>\r\n<h2>Overclock Body</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Biotech Engineering:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You've learned to use your body as a conduit for your tech powers. When you cast a tech power, you can choose to pay up to half the cost of the tech power using your hit points instead of your tech points. When you do so, your maximum hit points are reduced by the same amount. This effect is cumulative, and it lasts until you complete a long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>More Machine Than Man</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Biotech Engineering:</strong> 14th level</em></p>\r\n<p>While you have temporary hit points, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\r\n<h2>Focused Augmentation</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Biotech Engineering:</strong> 18th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You add your Intelligence modifier to Constitution saving throws you make to maintain concentration.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when you cast a power that requires concentration and would affect only one target, you can target an additional creature with that power.</p>\r\n<h2>Biotech Modifications</h2>\r\n<p>If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it.

For berserkers of the Brawling Approach, however, everything is their weapon.</p>\r\n<h2>Fists of Fury</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Brawling Approach:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You've learned to hone your rage through your fists. Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).</p>\r\n<h2>Reckless Strikes</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Brawling Approach:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>While you are raging, not wearing heavy armor, and not wielding a shield, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can choose to forgo your rage damage to make the attack a reckless strike.</p>\r\n<p>Some of your reckless strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the reckless strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reckless Strike save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<p>You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Bracing Strike</h3>\r\n<p>You gain temporary hit points equal to your rage damage bonus. If the target is grappled by you, you instead gain temporary hit points equal to twice your rage damage bonus.</p>\r\n<h3>Punishing Strike</h3>\r\n<p>Your target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is deafened until the start of its next turn. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead incapacitated until the start of its next turn.</p>\r\n<h3>Staggering Strike</h3>\r\n<p>Your target must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the target chooses the ability score to use). On a failed save, your target is pushed back 5 feet. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead knocked prone.</p>\r\n<h2>Shattering Strikes</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Brawling Approach:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your rage causes your strikes to overcome the hardest of materials. While raging, you gain the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Your unarmed strikes and improved weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.</li>\r\n<li>Your unarmed strikes deal double damage against structures.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>Stop Hitting Each Other</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Brawling Approach:</strong> 10th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can grapple creatures two sizes larger than you, instead of one. </p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you can use creatures you have grappled that are at least one size smaller than you as improvised weapons. When you do so, when you hit with an attack using a creature as a weapon, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.</p>\r\n<h2>Enforcer</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Brawling Approach:</strong> 14th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do so, your critical hit range increases by 1 for that attack, and on a hit, you deal maximum damage instead of rolling.</p>"

A favored tool of assassins, crime lords, and moguls: food. Those scholars who choose the Chef Pursuit know the importance and power that food carries.</p>\r\n<h2>Culinary Knowledge</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Chef Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain proficiency with chef's kits and your choice of the Nature or Survival skills. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.</p>\r\n<h2>Emergency Supplements</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Chef Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You are prepared to assist allies with specially prepared, instantly effective supplements. When an ally is the target of your Critical Analysis feature and within 5 feet of you, you may expend a superiority die and give that ally the benefits of any maneuver exclusive to the Chef Pursuit, regardless of whether or not you've chosen it. </p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Chef Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain access to new maneuvers which reflect the progress of your studies into the culinary arts. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order. You may only use one maneuver that during a short or long rest at a time.</p>\r\n<h3>Allergens</h3>\r\n<p>As a bonus action while preparing or touching food, you may expend a superiority die and add to it an irritating allergen. At the start of each of its turns, a creature that consumes this food must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it subtracts half the result of your superiority die (rounded down, minimum of one) from the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throws it makes before the start of its next turn. The effect of this maneuver ends when the creature completes its next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\r\n<h3>Brain Food</h3>\r\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature gains a number of temporary force or tech points (their choice) equal to the number you roll on the superiority die. When an affected creature casts a force or tech power, the temporary force or tech points are spent first. An affected target can only benefit from one source of temporary force or tech points at a time, and they last until they're depleted or until the affected target completes their next short or long rest. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\r\n<h3>Debilitants</h3>\r\n<p>As a bonus action when preparing or touching food, you may expend a superiority die and add to it a subtle poison. Any creature that consumes this food must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, their hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to twice the number rolled on your superiority die + your maneuver modifier. The effect of this maneuver ends when the creature completes its next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\r\n<h3>Energizers</h3>\r\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature has their walking speed increased by 10 until the end of their next short or long rest. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\r\n<h3>Enhancers</h3>\r\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Once before the end of their next short or long rest, affected targets may add the result of the superiority die to a damage roll that would affect only one target. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\r\n<h3>Health Food</h3>\r\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the number you roll on the superiority die. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\r\n<h3>Muscle Relaxants</h3>\r\n<p>As a bonus action while preparing or touching food, you may expend a superiority die and add to it a fast acting muscle relaxant. At the start of each of its turns, a creature that consumes this food must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it subtracts the result of your superiority die from the first damage roll it makes before the start of its next turn. The effect of this maneuver ends when the creature completes its next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplements</h3>\r\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Once before the end of their next short or long rest, affected targets may add the result of the superiority die to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use this feature, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\r\n<h3>Vitamins</h3>\r\n<p>At the end of a short or long rest you may expend a superiority die and choose a number of friendly creatures up to your maneuver modifier (minimum of one), if they ate food you prepared. Each creature gains proficiency in Constitution saving throws until the end of their next short or long rest. If a creature was already proficient in Constitution saving throws, they instead become proficient in a saving throw of your choice. This maneuver has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\r\n<h2>Balanced Diet</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Chef Pursuit:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your cooking is so nutritionally balanced that it allows allies to stave off the effects of continued rigorous activity. Creatures of your choice who eat food prepared by you have advantage on Constitution saving throws to avoid exhaustion, as described in chapter 8, until the end of their next long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Comfort Food</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Chef Pursuit:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>If you or any friendly creatures who have consumed food you prepared during a short rest regain hit points by spending hit dice at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d8 hit points.</p>\r\n<p>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 11th level, and to 1d12 at 15th level.</p>\r\n<h2>Heroes' Feast</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Chef Pursuit:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You have developed a signature feast that is the purest distillation of your knowledge and talent as a chef.</p>\r\n<p>Over the course of a long rest, you can expend rare culinary supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your feast, which can feed a number of creatures equal to twice your Critical Analysis modifier. Any creature partaking in the feast gains the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>It is cured of all poisons and disease, and becomes immune to poison and disease.</li>\r\n<li>It makes Wisdom saving throws to avoid being frightened with advantage.</li>\r\n<li>Its hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 2d10.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>These benefits last until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.</p>\r\n<h2>Chef Discoveries</h2>\r\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect the progress of your studies into the culinary arts. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order. </p>\r\n<h3>Alternative Fuel</h3>\r\n<p>Any of your chef features, maneuvers, or discoveries can now affect droids and constructs.</p>\r\n<h3>Banquet</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 17th level, Full Course</em></p>\r\n<p>Over the course of a long or short rest, you may utilize an additional maneuver from this archetype (total of four).</p>\r\n<h3>Filling Meal</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Over the course of a long or short rest, you may utilize up to two different maneuvers from this archetype, rather than one.</p>\r\n<h3>Full Course</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 12th level, Filling Meal</em></p>\r\n<p>Over the course of a long or short rest, you may utilize an additional maneuver from this archetype (total of three).</p>\r\n<h3>On the Rocks</h3>\r\n<p>Any food you prepare over a short or long rest carries with it an additional cooling effect. Creatures that consume it are considered adapted to hot climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. Additionally, the first time a creature who eats your food takes fire damage before the end of their next short or long rest, they are considered resistant to the damage.</p>\r\n<h3>Secret Ingredient</h3>\r\n<p>If you or any friendly creature that has consumed food made by you during their last short or long rest gains temporary hit points, the number of temporary hit points they gain increases by an amount equal to your Critical Analysis modifier.</p>\r\n<h3>Spice of Life</h3>\r\n<p>Any food you prepare over a short or long rest carries with it an additional warming effect. Creatures that consume it are considered adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, until the end of the creature's next long rest or 24 hours have passed. Additionally, the first time a creature who eats your food takes cold damage before the end of their next short or long rest, they are considered resistant to the damage.</p>"

                "value": "<h1>Construction Engineering</h1>\r\n<p>Those engineers who choose the Construction Engineering discipline create portable, pre-built battlements that allow them to command the battlefield.</p>\r\n<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Construction Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain proficiency in constructor's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with constructor's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.</p>\r\n<h2>Portable Structure</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Construction Engineering:</strong> 3rd, 11th, and 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You have constructed a set of malleable, portable fortifications that can elevate you and your allies. Over the course of a long rest, you create a portable structure that travels with you. </p>\r\n<p>Your portable structure can only be directed by you, and you must have a tech focus in order to direct it remotely. If you lack a tech focus, you can instead direct it while it is within 5 feet of you. Your portable structure has the following features:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Its AC equals your tech save DC.</li>\r\n<li>It has a number of hit points equal to 5 x your engineer level. If your structure is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses and can't be used again until you spend 1 hour repairing it, which can be done during a short or long rest.</li>\r\n<li>You can restore missing hit points to your structure by casting the <em>mending</em> tech power on it, or by completing a short or long rest. Casting the <em>mending</em> tech power restores a number of missing hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), but it can't be repaired to more than half its hit point maximum in this way. Completing a short rest restores your structure to half its hit point maximum, and completing a long rest restores it to its hit point maximum.</li>\r\n<li>Your structure has two modes: dismantled and deployed. While dismantled, your structure's speed equals your own, it hovers 5 feet off the ground, takes up the space of a 5-foot cube, and weighs 500 lbs. This increases to a 10-foot cube and 1,000 lbs. at 11th level, and a 15-foot cube and 2,000 lbs. at 17th level as you upgrade it. While deployed, your structure's speed is 0 and it takes up space dictated by how its deployed.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>As an action, you can remotely deploy your structure at a space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, provided there is sufficient space to support it. This range increases to 60 feet at 11th level and 120 feet at 17th level. Automatic dismantling of your structure takes 1 minute, and can be initiated on your turn (no action required).</p>\r\n<p>You can deploy your choice from these structures a combined total of four times, and you gain more uses at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you use this feature in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Bridge</h3>\r\n<p>You deploy a bridge up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 3 feet thick. The bridge starts from the point at which you deploy it, and extends in a direction of your choice. When you dismantle your bridge, it retracts to the point at which you initially deployed it. Both ends of the bridge must be supported in some fashion; one end cannot be suspended in the air or on unstable terrain. The bridge can hold up to 1,000 lbs., any weight above which causes the bridge to instantly drop to 0 hit points, destroying it. If a creature is on the bridge when it is destroyed or dismantled, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful saving throw, it reaches the closest part of the bridge that has stable support, or it maintains a grip on your bridge as it retracts, as appropriate. On a failed save, it falls. </p>\r\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the bridge can now extend up to 45 feet long, 15 feet wide, and it can support up to 2,000 lbs. When you reach 17th level, the bridge can now extend up to 60 feet long, 20 feet wide, and it can support up to 4,000 lbs.</p>\r\n<h3>Cage</h3>\r\n<p>You create a cage that surrounds a cube up to 10 feet on each side centered on the target location. The cube is surrounded on all sides except the ground by 2-foot-thick walls. The walls and roof are completely opaque, and you choose whether the structure has a light source when you deploy it that provides bright light within the cube. Otherwise, the space within the cube is in complete darkness. The cage is permeable, allowing air, water, and sound to pass through it. You can attempt to trap unwilling Medium or smaller creatures inside the cage. When you deploy this structure in an unwilling creature's space, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, it can immediately move to nearest unoccupied space outside of the cage. Otherwise, it is trapped within the structure when it is deployed. </p>\r\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the cage can extend up to 15 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Large size or smaller. When you reach 17th level, the cage can extend up to 20 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Huge size or smaller. </p>\r\n<h3>Shelter</h3>\r\n<p>You erect a shelter up to 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall, with one-foot-thick walls, a roof, and a floor. It has a single door along its walls in a location of your choice. The building has temperature control and lighting systems, and can withstand harsh winds, heavy rain and snow. Any creature inside the shelter is protected from hazardous environmental effects outside the shelter such as extreme heat or cold. The structure does not provide additional breathing air for anyone inside if the environment it is placed in is not breathable. The shelter can comfortably support up to 5 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures.</p>\r\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the shelter can extend up to 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, 15 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, they regain all spent Hit Dice, instead of only half. When you reach 17th level, the shelter can extend up to 45 feet long, 20 feet wide, 20 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Large creatures. For each Large creature, it can instead support 2 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, their exhaustion level is reduced by 2, instead of only 1.</p>\r\n<h3>Tower</h3>\r\n<p>You erect a tower from a 5-foot square platform centered on the target location that rises up to 30 feet. If the tower is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the tower. A creature can choose to fail the save. The tower comes equipped with a ladder that reaches from the ground to the platform. </p>\r\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the tower's platform can extend 5 feet by 10 feet and rise up to 40 feet. When you reach 17th level, the tower's platform can cover a 10-foot square, and rise up to 50 feet. Additionally, any creature on the tower's platform has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>\r\n<h3>Wall</h3>\r\n<p>You deploy a wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 10 feet in diameter, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick. The wall features ramparts deep enough to support creatures of Medium size or smaller, and provides one-quarter cover to any creature on its ramparts. The wall includes a ladder on the side of your choice. You choose whether the wall contains any openings otherwise. Any openings chosen in this way can be seen through on both sides. The wall can be climbed, but requires a Strength (Athletics) check against your tech save DC for any creature without a climbing speed. A creature can only make this check once per turn. </p>\r\n<p>When you reach 11th level, the wall can deploy up to 45 feet long and 15 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 15 feet in diameter and 15 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides half cover to any creature on its ramparts. When you reach 17th level, the wall can deploy up to 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter and 20 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides three-quarters cover to any creature on its ramparts.</p>\r\n<h2>Potent Fortifications</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Construction Engineering:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>When a friendly creature other than you that you can see is hit with a ranged attack while within 5 feet of your deployed portable structure, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to have your structure take the damage instead. If your structure would normally have immunity or resistance to this damage, it loses that immunity or resistance for this attack. When you do so, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier + your engineer level.</p>\r\n<h2>Build and Destroy</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Construction Engineering:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You've learned how to manipulate the weak points in structures with your technology. Your tech powers and weapon attacks gain the siege property, and your portable structures have resistance to kinetic, energy, and ion damage dealt by weapons.</p>\r\n<h2>Structural Knowledge</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Construction Engineering:</strong> 14th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can spend 1 hour inspecting and looking over a structure you can see from every angle available to you and comparing it to data you have on hand. At the end of the hour, you learn the basic blueprints for the structure, including but not limited to:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>The structure's total hit points.</li>\r\n<li>Any common materials that make up the structures.</li>\r\n<li>Whether or not the structure is in use or abandoned.</li>\r\n<li>The total floor count for the structure, as well as the general purpose of each floor if it was created to suit a specific purpose.</li>\r\n<li>All non-secret entrances (including doors, windows, vents, pipe systems) and where you could find them.</li>\r\n<li>A basic map-layout of every floor and ventilation system for the building.</li>\r\n<li>The history of the building such as what company or species could have constructed it, as well as how long it's been built.</li>\r\n<li>Any structural weak points it might have.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, when you make an Investigation check while searching this structure for hidden structural elements, such as doors or passages, if you have constructor's implements, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\r\n<h2>Master Builder</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Construction Engineering:</strong> 18th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your ability with your portable structures has reached untold superiority. You gain the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>You can have two structures active at a time, instead of only one, as you learn to more efficiently use your portable structure.</li>\r\n<li>Your structures no longer take double damage from the siege property.</li>\r\n<li>Your structures no longer automatically fail Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. Instead, your structure adds your proficiency bonus to the d20 roll when it makes one of these saving throws.</li>"

The object lands at its feet.</p>\r\n<h3>Inner Strength</h3>\r\n<p>As an action, you can expend and roll one superiority die, gaining temporary hit points equal to the result of the roll + your maneuver modifier.</p>\r\n<h3>One With Shadows</h3>\r\n<p>When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action and expend one superiority die to become invisible until you move or take a hostile action.</p>\r\n<h3>Rattle</h3>\r\n<p>On your turn, when you hit with a weapon attack, you can use a bonus action and expend and roll one superiority die to menace your target, dealing extra psychic damage equal to to the amount rolled and forcing it to succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check to steel its resolve and end this condition.</p>\r\n<h3>Tenacity</h3>\r\n<p>As a bonus action, you can expend and roll a superiority die and move to an unoccupied space you can see up to a distance equal to 5 x the result of the roll. If you begin this movement hidden from a creature, and you end this movement in a space that could be hidden from the creature, this movement does not reveal your presence to that creature.</p>\r\n<h3>Vanity</h3>\r\n<p>If the target of your Critical Analysis is reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend and roll a superiority die, regaining a number of hit points equal to the result of the roll + your maneuver modifier.</p>\r\n<h3>World on Fire</h3>\r\n<p>On your turn, when you hit with a weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to expend and roll one superiority die to ignite phosphorescent powder on your target, dealing extra fire damage equal to the result of the roll. Additionally, the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can't become invisible until the end of your next turn, and becomes visible if it was already invisible. </p>\r\n<h2>Extra Attack</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Detective Pursuit:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\r\n<h2>Sharp Instincts</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Detective Pursuit:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Once on each of your turns, when you hit the target of your Critical Analysis with a melee weapon attack, you can make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If you win the contest, you deal an additional 1d8 damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage</p>\r\n<p>This die increases to d10 at 13th level and d12 at 17th level.</p>\r\n<h2>Discombobulate</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Detective Pursuit:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When you use a scholar maneuver on a hostile creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, the target is stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>\r\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Detective Discoveries</h2>\r\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your investigative prowess.

They use these techniques to manipulate their opponent, moving them across the battlefield before incapacitating them.</p>\r\n<h2>Clinch Strike</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Disabling Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn how to discourage, debilitate, and harm your enemies. You gain the following benefits while you aren't wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Your damage die for your unarmed strikes and natural weapons increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8), and you can apply your Sneak Attack damage when you hit with an unarmed strike.</li>\r\n<li>You don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if the target of your Sneak Attack is a creature grappled by you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.</li>\r\n<li>You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>Skilled Grappler</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Disabling Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn a number of grappling techniques to subdue your opponents. When you hit a creature grappled by you with an unarmed strike and deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a grappling technique.</p>\r\n<p>Some of your grappling techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the grappling technique's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: </p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<p><strong>Grapple Technique save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<h3>Constrict</h3>\r\n<p>You attempt to choke the target into unconsciousness. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your following turn.  </p>\r\n<p>If you maintain this technique for 1 minute, the target falls unconscious for 1 hour. Droids and constructs can not be knocked unconscious in this way.</p>\r\n<h3>Disarm</h3>\r\n<p>You attempt to disarm a weapon or other object the target is holding. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it releases the object. If you have a free hand, you can catch the object. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.</p>\r\n<h3>Hip Toss</h3>\r\n<p>You attempt to throw your target to the ground. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet, knocked prone, and stunned until the start of your next turn. This ends the grapple.</p>\r\n<h2>Human Shield</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Disabling Practice:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn to manipulate the body of a grappled target to make attacks against you more difficult to land. Moving a grappled creature the same size as you or smaller no longer halves your speed, and when a creature grappled by you would grant you half cover, you instead have three-quarters cover. Additionally, when you are hit by an attack while grappling a creature, you can use your reaction to force that attack to instead hit the grappled creature.</p>\r\n<h2>Kiss the Wall</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Disabling Practice:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can use your surroundings to further punish the target of your grapple. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Sneak Attack damage die for an unarmed strike you make against a creature grappled by you, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</p>\r\n<h2>Neck Snap</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Disabling Practice:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn how to immediately remove your grappled opponent from the fight. As an action, you can force a creature grappled by you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, if the creature has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. If the target has more than 100 hit points, it immediately takes 10d10 true damage. </p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>"

With their deep understanding of both their weapon and how to manipulate its ammunition on the fly, they can often turn the tides of a battle with a single shot.</p>\r\n<h2>Studied Shooter</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Enhancement Specialist:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn specialized theory typical for practitioners of the enhancement trade. You gain proficiency in your choice of the Lore or Technology skills. Additionally, you learn your choice of the <em>encrypted message</em> or <em>minor image</em> tech power. Intelligence is your techcasting ability for these powers.  </p>\r\n<h2>Special Ammunition</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Enhancement Specialist:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn ammunition enhancements that are fueled by amplified shots to unleash special enhanced effects.</p>\r\n<h3>Ammunition Enhancements</h3>\r\n<p>You know two ammunition enhancements of your choice, which are detailed under \"Ammunition Enhancements\" below, and you earn more at higher levels. Many ammunition enhancements boost an attack in some way. Once per turn when you fire a shot from a blaster as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Ammunition Enhancement options to that shot,</p>\r\n<p>You gain an additional Ammunition Enhancement option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.</p>\r\n<p>Each time you learn new ammunition enhancements, you can also replace one ammunition enhancement you know with a different one.</p>\r\n<h3>Amplified Shots</h3>\r\n<p>You have two amplified shots, which you use to activate your ammunition enhancements. An amplified shot is expended when you use it. When you fire an amplified shot, your weapon is treated as enhanced for overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage. You decide to use the option when the shot hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You regain all of your amplified shots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Saving Throws</h3>\r\n<p>Some of your ammunition enhancements require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ammunition save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<h2>Ammunition Enhancements</h2>\r\n<p>The ammunition enhancements are presented in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h3>Carbonite Shot</h3>\r\n<p>When this shot strikes its target, shards of carbonite wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 cold damage, it gains 1 slowed level, and it takes 2d6 kinetic damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the carbonite with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Special Ammunition save DC. Otherwise, the carbonite lasts for 1 minute or until you use this option again.</p>\r\n<p>The cold damage and kinetic damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\r\n<h3>Coercing Shot</h3>\r\n<p>You enhance your shot with chemicals that confuse the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.</p>\r\n<p>The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\r\n<h3>Explosive Shot</h3>\r\n<p>You fire a shot set to explode on impact. The shot detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 fire damage each.</p>\r\n<p>The fire damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\r\n<h3>Hallucinogen Shot</h3>\r\n<p>You enhance your shot with hallucinogenic chemicals. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\r\n<h3>Piercing Shot</h3>\r\n<p>You enhance your shot with armor-piercing properties. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the shot shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</p>\r\n<p>The extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\r\n<h3>Quell Shot</h3>\r\n<p>You fire a shot enhanced with a debilitating poison. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p>The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\r\n<h3>Seeking Shot</h3>\r\n<p>You apply a tracing signal to your shot. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the shot disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 kinetic damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.</p>\r\n<p>The kinetic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>\r\n<h2>Enhanced Shot</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Enhancement Specialist:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain the ability to enhance your shots. Whenever you fire an unenhanced shot from a blaster, you can make it enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.</p>\r\n<h2>Redirected Shot</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Enhancement Specialist:</strong> 10th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with an enhanced shot and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.</p>\r\n<h2>Ever-Ready Shot</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Enhancement Specialist:</strong> 15th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your enhanced ammunition is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Special Ammunition remaining, you regain one use of it.</p>\r\n<h2>Ammunition Upgrades</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Enhancement Specialist:</strong> 18th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your ammunition enhancements improve.</p>"

When you do, one creature within 60 feet of you or all creatures that are targeted by your Critical Analysis has to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your maneuver save DC.</p>\r\n<p>On a failure, they take damage equal to the roll and their movement speed becomes 0 until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h3>Superior Counterattack</h3>\r\n<p>Whenever an opportunity attack targets a friendly creature other than you that is in an area targeted by your Critical Analysis feature, you can expend a superiority die. The creature can use its reaction to make a single weapon attack, adding the superiority die roll to the attack roll. </p>\r\n<h3>Wrestle and Drag</h3>\r\n<p>When you or a creature that is the target of your Critical Analysis makes an Strength (Athletics) check to grapple or shove a creature, you can expend a superiority die and add it to the roll. Until the end of your turn, you can drag the grappled creature with you without your speed being halved. Additionally, if you move at least 5 feet, the creature takes damage for each foot moved up to an amount equal to half your Scholar level + your maneuver modifier.</p>\r\n<h2>Field Advantage</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Explorer Pursuit:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn to quickly convey spatial information in the midst of combat about the area you analyzed, giving them an edge at maneuvering in the area. While moving through your Surveyed Area, you and friendly creatures of your choice ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and opportunity attacks against them are made with disadvantage.</p>\r\n<h2>Unstoppable Adventurer</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Explorer Pursuit:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn to swim and scale vertical surfaces with ease. You gain swimming and climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, your Sage Advice feature can be used to give friendly creatures knowledge on how to swim or climb, provided you have a swimming or climbing speed. Chosen creatures have a swimming speed or climbing speed for the entire duration.</p>\r\n<h2>Survey Master</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Explorer Pursuit:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When you use the Surveyed Area feature, the area affected is a 30-foot cube instead of a 15-foot cube.</p>\r\n<h2>Explorer Discoveries</h2>\r\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your studies in maps and hidden routes. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h3>Cover Adept</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 12th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You treat one-quarter cover as half cover, half cover as three-quarters cover, and three-quarters cover as full cover. Additionally, while you are in cover, Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make gain a bonus equal to your Critical Analysis modifier (minimum of +1).</p>\r\n<h3>Dungeon Explorer</h3>\r\n<p>You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and Intelligence (Investigation) checks to locate any secret doors or traps, and you have resistance to damage dealt by traps.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you can use your Sage Advice feature to teach friendly creatures about various types of traps, following the same rules of that feature. When you do so, the chosen creatures have resistance to damage dealt by traps.</p>\r\n<h3>Galactic Explorer</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When you make an Intelligence (Piloting) check and add your proficiency bonus to the check, treat any roll of 9 or lower as if you had rolled a 10. </p>\r\n<h3>Grappling Hunter</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Attack rolls that you make against creatures that you are grappling have advantage. </p>\r\n<h3>High Ground</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Once per turn, when you or a friendly creature hits a creature that is a target of your Critical Analysis feature, it takes additional damage equal to half your Critical Analysis modifier (rounded down, minimum of +1). </p>\r\n<h3>No Stone Left Unturned</h3>\r\n<p>When you make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to find a hidden creature that is inside the area that is targeted by your Critical Analysis feature, you do so with advantage. </p>\r\n<h3>Versatile Explorer</h3>\r\n<p>You can hold your breath twice as long as you are normally able to, and take half as much damage from fall damage.</p>"

Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order. </p>\r\n<h3>Adapted Hide</h3>\r\n<p>When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, you are adapted to hot or cold climates (your choice), as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

If a tech power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of them. </p>\r\n<p>Casting tech powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a tech power that requires a tech attack.</p>\r\n<h2>Explosive Resilience</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Industrial Approach:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Once per round, when you deal damage that includes your rage damage, you can cause a localized explosion around the recipient of that damage. Each creature within 5 feet of the damaged creature other than you takes acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) equal to your rage damage bonus, and you gain resistance to the chosen damage type until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier.

Additionally, when you hit a creature with it, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet. Lastly, while active, you can use Strength instead of Dexterity when determining your AC, as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.</p>\r\n<h3>Fire</h3>\r\n<p>Your flaming weapon sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, deals fire damage, and when you hit a creature with it, the creature takes additional damage equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, rounded up, minimum of one).</p>\r\n<h3>Water</h3>\r\n<p>Your watery weapon has the reach property, deals cold damage on a hit, and you can use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of Dexterity or Strength for its attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack, you can instead use your weapon to wet a 5-foot square within your weapon's reach. The  affected area is difficult terrain. Each creature who starts its turn in the square or enters it for the first time must make a Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failed save.</p>\r\n<h2>Elemental Adept</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Kro Var Order:</strong> 6th, 11th, and 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain two of the following features. You gain an additional option at 11th and 17th level. </p>\r\n<p>You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 2 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 2 until you complete a long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Burning Ember Flourish</h3>\r\n<p>You can use your action to choose an area of flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within 60 feet. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Fireworks.</strong></em> The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Smoke.</strong></em> Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.</p>\r\n<h3>Curtain of Unyielding Wind</h3>\r\n<p>As an action, you call up a mighty gale, which swirls around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for 10 minutes. The wind deafens both you and other creatures in its area. It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller and hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind. The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you and the attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.</p>\r\n<h3>Crushing Hand of the Mountain</h3>\r\n<p>As an action, you can choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet. A Medium hand made from soil and stone, which lasts for 1 minute, rises in that space and reaches for one Large or smaller creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 kinetic damage and is restrained for the duration. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your focus save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand. As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.</p>\r\n<h3>Hatchling's Flame</h3>\r\n<p>As an action, you focus your energy into a torrent of fire that streaks away from you. A line of roaring flame </p>\r\n<p>30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\r\n<h3>Patient Bantha Listens</h3>\r\n<p>You reach out to the ground beneath you. You can use your bonus action to gain tremorsense with a range of 30 feet and a burrow speed equal to your walking speed for up to 1 minute. Your movement leaves behind a tunnel that remains for as long as this ability is active, after which it collapses.</p>\r\n<h3>Rush of the Shyrack</h3>\r\n<p>As an action, you form a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that blasts from you in a direction you choose for one minute or until you lose concentration or dismiss the effect (no action required). Each Large or smaller creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.</p>\r\n<h3>Shape the Raincloud</h3>\r\n<p>You can use your action pull water from air, and return it to the atmosphere. In an open container, you can create up to 20 gallons of drinkable water. You may also produce a rain that falls within a 30-foot cube and extinguishes open-air flames. You can destroy the same amount of water in an open container, or destroy a 30-foot cube of fog.</p>\r\n<h3>Swarming Ice Rabbit</h3>\r\n<p>As an action, you can cause a flurry of ice crystals to erupt from a point you can see within 90 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.</p>\r\n<h2>Elemental Master</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Kro Var Order:</strong> 11th and 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>At 11th level, you gain one of the following features. You gain an additional option at 17th level.</p>\r\n<p>You can use these features a combined number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 3 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 3 until you complete a long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Earth Reaches for Sky</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Crushing Hand of the Mountain</em> or <em>Patient Bantha Listens</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you can choose a point you can see on the ground within 120 feet. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p>\r\n<h3>Ride the Wind</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Curtain of Unyielding Wind</em> or <em>Rush of the Shyrack</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you can gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed for 10 minutes. You can hover while this technique is active, but when it ends, you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall.</p>\r\n<h3>River of Hungry Flame</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Burning Ember Flourish</em> or <em>Hatchling's Flame</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you can create a wall of fire on a solid surface within 120 feet. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute.</p>\r\n<p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>\r\n<p>One side of the wall, chosen by you when you use this feature, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side of the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.</p>\r\n<h3>Shape the Flowing River</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Shape the Rainclud</em> or <em>Swarming Ice Rabbit</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you can control any freestanding water within 300 feet of you inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you use this feature. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.<strong><em>Flood.</strong></em> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller creatures struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of being knocked prone. The water level remains elevated until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Part Water.</strong></em> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the feature's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Redirect Flow.</strong></em> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the feature's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the feature ends or you choose a different effect.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Whirlpool.</strong></em> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your feature save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and is caught in the vortex until the feature ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 kinetic damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>\r\n<h2>Elemental Paragon</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Kro Var Order:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain one of the following features. </p>\r\n<p>Once you've used the chosen feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<p>While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 4 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 4 until you complete a long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Archetype of Air</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Ride the Wind</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you conjure a whirlwind around you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Ranged attacks made against you have disadvantage.</li>\r\n<li>You gain a flying speed of 60 feet. If you are still flying when the technique ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it.</li>\r\n<li>You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.</p>\r\n<h3>Figure of Flame</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> River of Hungry Flame</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you cause flames to race across your body, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>You have resistance to fire damage.</li>\r\n<li>The flames shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.</li>\r\n<li>Any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 1d10 fire damage.</li>\r\n<li>You can use your action to create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.</p>\r\n<h3>Icon of Ice</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Shape the Flowing River</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you cause frost to chill the area around you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>You have resistance to cold damage.</li>\r\n<li>You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.</li>\r\n<li>The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.</li>\r\n<li>You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing ice extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.</p>\r\n<h3>Embodiment of Earth</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Earth Reaches for Sky</em></p>\r\n<p>As an action, you cause rock to envelop you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.</li>\r\n<li>You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without spending extra movement. You can move through solid earth or stone as if it was air without destabilizing it, but you can't end your movement there. If you do so, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.</li>\r\n<li>You can use your action to create a small earthquake on the ground in a 15-foot radius centered on you. Other creatures on that ground must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.</p>\r\n<h2>Avatar</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Kro Var Order:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>As an ultimate display of your mastery of the elements, you can spend 5 focus points as an action to have the elements of water, earth, fire, and air form a protective sphere around your body, gaining multiple benefits for 1 minute. While this ability is active, you have resistance to cold, energy, fire, kinetic, lightning, and sonic damage. You also gain a burrow, fly, and swim speed equal to your movement speed. Lastly, you can use any of the following abilities as a bonus action:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>You create a small earthquake on the ground in a 15-foot radius around you. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 kinetic damage and is knocked prone.</li>\r\n<li>You create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose.

Additionally, when you throw an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient in it, and it uses your Martial Arts die instead of its 1d4. </p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you've learned to use thrown weapons to intercept projectiles traveling towards your allies. When you are wielding a weapon with which you are proficient, and a creature within your weapon's normal thrown range is hit by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to throw your weapon to intercept the projectile. When you do so, the damage the creature takes from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a lethal strike. </p>\r\n<p>Some of your lethal strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the lethal strike's effects.

The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the GM tells you two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Highest ability score</li>\r\n<li>Lowest ability score</li>\r\n<li>Strongest saving throw</li>\r\n<li>Weakest saving throw</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Vulnerable Strike</h3>\r\n<p>You attempt to stagger the target.

On a failed save, the next time you would make an attack roll against the target before the end of your next turn, you can instead force the target to make a saving throw with the ability score of your choice. On a failed save, the creature takes normal weapon damage and you can apply your Sneak Attack dice to the roll.</p>\r\n<h2>Poisoner</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Lethality Practice:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You are a master of poisons. You can apply a poison as a bonus action, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal the application of poisons. </p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you can improve the capability of one dose of poison. To use this benefit, you must have a poisoner's kit, and the poison must be within reach.

It disintegrates at the end of this duration. For the duration, you can see and hear the target through the doll as if you were within 5 feet of the creature.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, as action while the doll is in your possession, you can expend a Hit Die to torment the target, choosing an effect from the following options:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Burn:</strong> The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw.

The slowed levels effect lasts for 1 hour.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The target can only be under 1 effect at a time. When you use a new effect, any existing effects end.

On a failed save, their attempt fails, and any force or tech points spent in this way are wasted.</p>\r\n<h2>Occultist Discoveries</h2>\r\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your research on the occult. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h3>Arcane Membrane</h3>\r\n<p>You have advantage on Intelligence (Lore) or Intelligence (Nature) checks.</p>\r\n<h3>Evil Eye</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can cast the <em>bestow curse</em> and <em>remove curse</em> force powers without spending force points. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting modifier for these powers.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've cast a power using this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can cast it again.</p>\r\n<h3>Exsanguination</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When a creature marked by your Curse of Objurgation is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction and expend a Hit Die to immediately regain a use of your Curse of Objurgation.</p>\r\n<h3>Hexes and Superstitions </h3>\r\n<p>When you roll a 13 on an ability check, you treat it as if you rolled a 20.</p>\r\n<h3>Natural Karma</h3>\r\n<p>Before you use a maneuver or power to set a curse on a target you can see, you can make a contested Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, the target is unaware you set the curse on them.</p>\r\n<h3>Savage Sortilege</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You ignore resistance to psychic damage, and you have resistance to psychic damage.</p>\r\n<h3>Supernatural Vigor</h3>\r\n<p>At the end of a long rest, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet (this includes you) to imbue with unnatural power.

                "value": "<h1>Path of Communion</h1>\r\n<p>Those who master the Force can transcend death, persisting beyond their natural experation. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Communion bond with a Force ghost, developing a symbiotic relationship which alters the way they perceive their surroundings.</p>\r\n<h2>Mystical Connection</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Path of Communion:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn the <em>feedback</em> force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use all three Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and the target fails its saving throw. Finally, when you deal psychic damage with the <em>feedback</em> force power, you deal additional psychic damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) if it doesn't already include that modifier.</p>\r\n<h2>Symbiot Spirit</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Path of Communion:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You attract the attention of the spirit of a Force ghost. Over the course of one hour, you can attune to the spirit, forging a lasting connection. While attuned to a spirit, you gain the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>Your spirit is always audible and visible to you. Your spirit can choose to make itself audible and visible or inaudible and invisible to other creatures (no action required), but it is always visible to beings with truesight.</li>\r\n<li>Your spirit can not interact with the corporeal world, but it is also not impeded by unenhanced walls or barriers.</li>\r\n<li>Your spirit acts independently of you, and it only obeys your commands if it chooses to. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. Your spirit can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</li>\r\n<li>While your spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can telepathically communicate with it. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your spirit's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</li>\r\n<li>When you cast a force power with a range of touch, your spirit can deliver the power as if it had cast it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>You can only attune to one spirit at a time. If you attempt to attune to another spirit, you immediately break the bond with your current spirit.</p>\r\n<p>> #### Generating Your Spirit</p>\r\n<p>> Your spirit might be the ghost of a benevolent Jedi, discovered in the ruins of a Jedi temple, or a powerful Sith spirit lingering in an ancient artifact. It might be the spirit of a Nightsister sorceress, or a paragon of a long-forgotten monastic order. Work with your GM to determine the nature of your spirit.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, your spirit can briefly interact with the physical world. When you would make a melee attack, your spirit can deliver the attack as if it had made it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the attack. It uses your modifiers for the attack and damage rolls. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Invasive Presence</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Path of Communion:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your spirit can invade another creature's being. As an action, your spirit can touch a creature within 5 feet of it, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. </p>\r\n<p>On a failed save, your spirit moves into that creatures space, inhabiting its body, for 1 minute. The affected creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes each turn. At the end of each its turns, the creature repeats this save. On a success, it repels the spirit from its body, and it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h2>Ethereal Vision</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Path of Communion:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You and your guiding spirit both gain truesight out to 60 feet as long as your spirit is within 100 feet of you.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when you use your action to see through your spirit's senses, you are no longer deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, able to comprehend what happens in both perspectives simultaneously.</p>\r\n<h2>Assuming Direct Control</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Path of Communion:</strong> 18th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When a creature fails its saving throw against your Invasive Presence feature, the target becomes charmed by you for as long as Invasive Presence is active.</p>\r\n<p>While the target is charmed, you and your spirit have a telepathic link with it as long as you are within 100 feet of it. You and your spirit can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as \"Attack that creature,\" \"Run over there,\" or \"Fetch that object.\" If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p>\r\n<p>You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.</p>"

On a roll of 10 or lower, you instead appear as an indistinguishably blurred form roughly your normal height and weight, though a being with truesight sees you normally. Regardless of your appearance, for the duration, your speed doubles, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move through creatures and objects willingly though you can not affect them and they can not affect you. You can end this feature early on your turn (no action required).

You can still die of old age, however. Additionally, you no longer need food or water, and you no longer need to sleep. Lastly, the first time you take damage on each of your turns, you can roll your Kinetic Combat die and reduce the damage by that amount.</p>"

If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you regardless of its appearance, and it occupies its own space. On your turn, you can mentally command the familiar to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your familiar is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed. While you have a familiar, you gain the following benefits:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>As a bonus action, you can use your magicks to teleport, swapping places with your familiar at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.</li>\r\n<li>When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the familiar's space. You make this choice for each attack.</li>\r\n<li>When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your familiar moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the familiar's space.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Starting at 11th level, you can summon your familiar when you deal damage with any force power, instead of just necrotic. Additionally, you can summon your familiar when you use a Force-Empowered Self option on your turn.</p>\r\n<h2>Nature's Vigor</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Path of Witchcraft:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You've learned to attune your senses with nature. If you spend at least 1 minute meditating while in nature, you gain the following benefits for 1 hour:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>You ignore difficult terrain caused by nature.</li>\r\n<li>You can understand plants within 30 feet of you. They can telepathically communicate simple ideas to you, including memories from within the past day.</li>\r\n<li>You can command plants within 30 feet of you to create difficult terrain, or other tasks at the GM's discretion (no action required).</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h2>Waters of Life</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Path of Witchcraft:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You've learned to absorb the fleeting magicks of your familiar. When your familiar is destroyed by taking damage, you can choose to grant temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) to one friendly creature of your choice you can see within 30 feet.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the sentinel table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Stormcaller</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Path of Witchcraft:</strong> 18th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You've learned to command the elements to summon a fierce storm in a 30-foot radius around you.

Additionally, you can use Deflection and Slow Time Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save.

The target and each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the detonator adhered to a target, the creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. A creature takes force damage using your Kinetic Combat die + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. </p>\r\n<h2>Energized Kinetics</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Path of the Corsair:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Once per turn, when you deal damage with a Force-Empowered Detonator or your Double Strike feature, you can deal additional damage using your Kinetic Combat die.

Additionally, if you are grappled or restrained, and you could use your action to attempt to end the effect, you can instead use your bonus action.</p>\r\n<h2>Razor Focus</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Pugnacity Practice:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can enter a hyper-focused state of mind for 1 minute as a bonus action. You must maintain concentration, as if concentrating on a power. For the duration, each time you successfully deal Sneak Attack damage against a creature, you gain two additional Sneak Attack dice, cumulatively, as your attacks become increasingly precise. These additional dice are lost when your focus ends, whether through failing to maintain concentration or after 1 minute.</p>\r\n<p>The first time you use this feature, you suffer no ill effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you suffer one level of exhaustion each time you use it.</p>"

They incite chaos and make devious moves that keep their enemies reeling.</p>\r\n<h2>Rakish Audacity</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Ruffian Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your unmistakable confidence propels you into battle. You can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, as long as the target of the attack is within 5 feet of you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, during your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p>\r\n<h2>Nimble Step</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Ruffian Practice:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn to fluidly strike and maneuver through combat. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack Dice in order to maneuver across the battlefield.</p>\r\n<p>Some of your fancy footworks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the debilitating strike's effects.

On a failed save, your AC increases by the higher amount rolled on the dice against the first attack it makes against you before the start of your next turn. On a successful save, your AC instead increases by the lower amount.</p>\r\n<h3>Disarming Strike</h3>\r\n<p>You attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. If you have a free hand, you can catch the item. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.</p>\r\n<h3>Fancy Footwork</h3>\r\n<p>Roll two Sneak Attack dice. Your speed increases by 5 x the greater result of the two dice, and you ignore difficult terrain until the end of your current turn.</p>\r\n<h2>Panache</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Ruffian Practice:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.</p>\r\n<p>If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a power, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.</p>\r\n<p>If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.</p>\r\n<h2>Elegant Maneuver</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Ruffian Practice:</strong> 13th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.</p>\r\n<h2>Master Duelist</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Ruffian Practice:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>Your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat.

It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each droid trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of droid traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded up, minimum of one).</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, when you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher that would affect only one target, and your tracker droid companion is bonded and within 10 feet of you or your target, your tracker droid companion can use its reaction to increase the level at which you are casting your power by 1. This feature can increase a power's level above your Max Power Level, and using this feature does not cost additional tech points.</p>\r\n<p>At 11th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 30 feet of you or your target to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 60 feet.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the operative table.

Each creature within 5 feet of your tracker droid must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. A creature takes ion damage for each Hit Die expended in this way on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. The size of the damage die equals the size of your tracker droid's Hit Die. Any electronics not being worn or carried within the blast radius are disabled until rebooted.</p>\r\n<h4>Saboteur Practice Techcasting</h4>\r\n<h2>Sabotage</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Saboteur Practice:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain the ability to sabotage a tech power in the process of being cast. When a hostile creature casts a tech power, and you are the target of the tech power or within its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.</p>\r\n<p>On a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and the caster takes 1d6 lightning damage per level of the power it was casting. Additionally, on a failed save, the caster's tech focus used to cast the tech power is overloaded and can't be used to cast tech powers for 1 minute. </p>\r\n<p>At the end of each of the caster's turns, it can repeat the Intelligence saving throw. On a success, it can use the tech focus to cast tech powers again.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>"

                "value": "<h1>Slicer Pursuit</h1>\r\n<p>Across the galaxy one can find numerous pseudonyms and false identities belonging to the hackers and cyber-infiltrators that call the world of electronics home. Those scholars who choose the Slicer Pursuit put their impressive intellectual prowess to work in the field of technology, to ends both benevolent and malicious.</p>\r\n<h2>Hacker's Disposition</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Slicer Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain proficiency with slicer's kits and in the Technology skill. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.</p>\r\n<h2>Techcasting</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Slicer Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.</p>\r\n<h3>Tech Powers Known</h3>\r\n<p>You learn 3 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.</p>\r\n<h3>Tech Points</h3>\r\n<p>You have a number of tech points equal to half of your scholar level (rounded up), as shown in the Tech Points column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Max Power Level</h3>\r\n<p>Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Slicer Pursuit Techcasting table.</p>\r\n<p>You may only cast tech powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.</p>\r\n<h3>Techcasting Ability</h3>\r\n<p>Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tech save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tech attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p><em></em>_</p>\r\n<h3>Techcasting Focus</h3>\r\n<p>You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) as a tech focus for your tech powers.</p>\r\n<h2>Systems Hijack</h2>\r\n<p>Also at 3rd level, when the target of your Critical Analysis is a droid or construct, or wearing or holding a</p>\r\n<h4>Slicer Pursuit Techcasting</h4>\r\n<p>techcasting focus, that creature is a viable target for any tech powers with you cast with a range of touch.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when the target of your Critical Analysis casts a tech power, you can use your reaction to identify the tech power being cast, and at what level.</p>\r\n<h2>Additional Maneuvers</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Slicer Pursuit:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>You gain access to new maneuvers which reflect your understanding of tech casting. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h3>Automatic Startup Sequence</h3>\r\n<p>When a creature makes a saving throw against a tech power you cast, you may expend a superiority die, subtracting the number rolled from their total. You can use this maneuver before or after the creature makes saving throw, but before the GM determines whether or not the creature fails.</p>\r\n<h3>Fast Access Programs</h3>\r\n<p>When you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher that has a casting time of 1 action, you can expend a superiority die to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p>\r\n<h3>Firewall</h3>\r\n<p>When you or an ally you can see within 60 feet make a saving throw against a tech power, you can use your reaction to expend a superiority die, adding the number rolled to the result of that saving throw.</p>\r\n<h3>Hacked Communications</h3>\r\n<p>As an action, you may expend a superiority die, and choose any number of creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you that have commlinks, headcomms, or other such communications devices. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take sonic damage equal to the number rolled on the dice + your maneuver modifier (minimum of one). Additionally, on a failed save, their communication devices are disabled until rebooted.</p>\r\n<h3>Overcapacity Powers</h3>\r\n<p>When you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, you may expend a superiority die to cast the power at a higher level, provided is does not exceed your Maximum Power Level. Roll the superiority die, and add it to the level at which you are casting the power. You can choose to cast it at this new power level or lower.</p>\r\n<h3>Runtime Extension</h3>\r\n<p>When a tech power you cast with a duration of 1 minute or longer reaches the end of its duration, you may expend a superiority die to extend the duration of the power a number of rounds equal to the number rolled on your superiority die.</p>\r\n<h3>Subtle Execution</h3>\r\n<p>When you cast a tech power, you may expend a superiority die to cast the power without any visual or auditory cues. Creatures have disadvantage on any Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) checks made to determine if you were the caster.</p>\r\n<h2>Potent Programming</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Slicer Pursuit:</strong> 6th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against an at-will tech power you cast that deals damage, the creature takes half the power's damage, but suffers no additional effects of the power.</p>\r\n<h2>Redirect Error</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Slicer Pursuit:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When the target of your Critical Analysis feature casts a tech power that affects an area, you can use your reaction to cause that power to instead affect an area in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the caster. </p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h2>System Override</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Slicer Pursuit:</strong> 17th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You know how to quickly activate anti-tech subroutines you have encoded into your wristpad. You can cast the <em>diminish tech</em> and <em>tech override</em> powers at 3rd level without expending tech points. If the target is the target of your Critical Analysis, you have advantage on the techcasting ability check for these powers.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of time equal to half your Critical Analysis modifier (rounded down, a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<h2>Slicer Discoveries</h2>\r\n<p>When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your understanding of tech casting. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<h3>Administrator's Log</h3>\r\n<p>If you spend at least 10 minutes working on a computer or terminal, you can get a full list of users who have accessed the machine within the past 24 hours. Over the course of a long rest, you may then form a facsimile of identification that would allow you to pass yourself off as that person when accessing machines.</p>\r\n<h3>Backdoor Egress</h3>\r\n<p>When you cast a tech power that affects an area and requires a saving throw, and you are inside that power's area, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If you end this movement outside the area affected by the tech power, you do not have to make a saving throw to avoid its effects. </p>\r\n<h3>Intelligence Core Override</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 9th level</em></p>\r\n<p>You can cast the <em>override interface</em> tech power at 5th level without spending tech points. </p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h3>Resource Appropriation</h3>\r\n<p><em><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 11th level</em></p>\r\n<p>If you reduce the target of your Critical Analysis feature to 0 hit points, and it has tech point remaining, you may choose to gain any tech points it had remaining. Your current tech points cannot exceed your tech point maximum.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>\r\n<h3>Skillful Casting</h3>\r\n<p>When you hit a creature with an at-will tech power that requires an attack roll, you may treat that attack roll as a weapon attack for the purpose of using maneuvers.</p>\r\n<h3>Sleeper Program</h3>\r\n<p>Whenever you cast a tech power with a casting time of 1 action, you can choose to delay the power's activation up to a minute. When you do so, you cast the power as normal, but holds its energy for the duration of the delay. Holding onto the power's effect requires concentration. If your concentration is broken before the delay ends, the power dissipates without taking effect. You can use your reaction to activate the power at any time.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses  when you finish a long rest.</p>"

These portals last until the start of your next turn, and they are large enough to accommodate Medium and smaller creatures and objects. Portals take the appearance of an elongated, shimmering mirror, and looking through a portal, a creature can see through the linked portal as if looking through a window. A creature or object who passes through a portal immediately appears in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal. You can use your reaction to end your portals early. If a creature is partially within your portals, it is shunted back to the space it previously occupied and it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your a tech save DC. On a failed save, it takes energy damage equal to your scout level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\r\n<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest. At the beginning of each of your turns while you have a pair of portals active, you can expend a use of this feature to extend the duration of the portals until the start of your next turn (no action required).</p>\r\n<p>The distance at which you can create portals increases at higher levels. It increases to 60 feet at 5th level, 90 feet at 9th level, 150 feet at 13th level, 300 feet at 17th level, and 1,000 feet at 20th level.</p>\r\n<h2>Mark of the Teleporter</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Teleportation Technique:</strong> 3rd level</em></p>\r\n<p>On your turn, when you deal damage to the target of your Ranger's Quarry, and either you, your weapon, or the source of your damage have passed through your portals on this turn, when you roll below half the maximum on a damage die, you can treat the roll as if you'd rolled half the maximum on the damage die. You can only affect a number of dice up to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded up, minimum of one) in this way.</p>\r\n<h2>Residual Warp</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Teleportation Technique:</strong> 7th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place your portal in a place you've visited in the last 10 minutes, provided you can remember it, as opposed to a place you can see. That place must still be within range of your teleporter.</p>\r\n<h2>Quantum Entanglement</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Teleportation Technique:</strong> 11th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place the portal that you would normally place within 5 feet of you in a place you can see within your Personal Teleporter's range. If that space is occupied by a Huge or smaller creature or a Medium or smaller unsecured object, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. An object automatically fails this saving throw, and a creature can choose to fail. On a failed save, a Medium or smaller creature or object falls through the portal, immediately appearing in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal and falling prone. A Large or Huge creature instead falls prone without moving.</p>\r\n<h2>Reprisal</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>Teleportation Technique:</strong> 15th level</em></p>\r\n<p>When you would be affected by a weapon or tech power that requires a Dexterity saving throw or attack roll and would affect only you, you can use your reaction to instantaneously create a pair of portals to redirect that power to another target within 30 feet. If the weapon or power required a melee or ranged attack roll, make a melee or ranged tech attack roll against the new target, as appropriate. If it required a Dexterity saving throw, the new target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC.</p>\r\n<p>Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>"
